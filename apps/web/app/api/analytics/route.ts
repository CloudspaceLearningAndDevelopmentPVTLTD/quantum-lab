/**
 * /api/analytics — the ingestion endpoint that, by default, ingests nothing.
 *
 * Qubit16's analytics are local-first: events live in the visitor's own
 * browser and are read back by /insights. This route exists so a self-hosting
 * operator has a documented place to add storage, and so the client has
 * something honest to talk to if it is ever pointed at one. Out of the box no
 * storage is configured, so POST accepts a batch, validates and sanitizes it,
 * and tells the caller plainly that it was not stored.
 *
 * It never 500s on a bad body — a malformed batch is a 400 with a message.
