/**
 * GET /api/billing/entitlement?userId=...
 *
 * The client's read-only view of what the server thinks a user may do. It also
 * returns the derived plan, limits and feature list so the browser does not
 * recompute them.
 *
 * This endpoint is a COURTESY for the UI and it is NOT a gate. It once claimed
 * that "every route that grants a paid capability resolves the entitlement
 * itself, server-side"; that was false when it was written — `requireFeature`,
 * `recordHardwareJob` and `assertHardwareQuota` had zero callers, so the only
 * thing between a Free account and a real hardware job was `<UpgradeGate>` in
 * the browser. The callers exist now (POST /api/hardware/submit runs the whole
 * chain, and `lib/hardware/submitGate.test.ts` fails if any link is removed),
 * but that does not make THIS route a control: it reports, it does not refuse.
 * Nothing may be granted on the strength of what it returns. docs/BILLING.md §6.
 *
 * Always answers 200 — an unknown user is simply on the free tier.
 *
 * It does have one side effect, added deliberately: it is where a subscription
 * whose renewal webhook was missed gets repaired. See `reconcileIfStale` below
 * and docs/BILLING.md §8.
