/**
 * /api/credentials — BYOK: store, review and remove your OWN vendor credentials.
 *
 * ── AN API KEY CANNOT REACH THIS ROUTE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Identity comes from `verifiedCallerId`, which accepts a Supabase SESSION
 * token and nothing else — not `verifiedApiCaller`, which also accepts a
 * `qb16_sk_…` key. This is the same rule `/api/keys` follows and it matters
 * more here, not less.
 *
 * A `hardware:submit` key is a credential somebody puts in a CI environment
 * variable. If it could install a BYOK credential, a leaked key would let an
 * attacker attach THEIR vendor account to the victim's (making every job the
 * victim runs land in the attacker's console, results included), or replace
 * the victim's credential so their jobs silently start spending the operator's
 * allowance again. Neither is something a scoped script credential should be
 * able to do. Attaching a vendor account is an account action and requires the
 * account.
 *
 * Do not "simplify" this by switching to `verifiedApiCaller`.
 *
 * ── Secrets are write-only ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * POST accepts a credential and answers with the MASKED record. There is no
 * route, here or anywhere, that reads a stored secret back out to a client —
 * the listing type has no field for one
 * (`lib/security/providerCredentials.ts`). Same rule as an API key, for the
 * same reason: a credential that can be re-read is a credential that leaks
 * through whatever can read it.
 *
 * The NON-secret half does come back in full, on purpose: an AWS access key id
 * and an Azure client id are identifiers, and "which of my accounts is
 * attached?" is the question a credential listing exists to answer.
 *
 * ── This route is provider-agnostic, deliberately ───────────────────────────
 *
 * It never names a vendor's fields. Which fields exist, which are secret and
 * which are required all live in `PROVIDER_FIELDS`, and both the validation
 * and this route's own catalogue response read from there. Adding a provider
 * is an entry in that table plus the upstream plumbing — not an edit here.
 *
 * ── Why DELETE is not called "revoke" anywhere in this file ─────────────────
 *
 * Removing the row stops THIS platform from presenting the credential. It
 * stays valid at the vendor. The only real revocation is deleting the token in
 * IBM's console, the key in AWS IAM, or the client secret in the Azure app
 * registration — and the copy in the response body says so, because a user who
 * believes this button killed their credential will not go and actually kill
 * it.
