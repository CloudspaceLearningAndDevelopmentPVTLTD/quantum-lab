/**
 * /api/email — render a known template and hand it to the provider.
 *
 * The template set is closed: `type` selects one of four functions and the
 * caller can never supply raw HTML. An endpoint that accepts arbitrary bodies
 * and arbitrary recipients is a spam relay wearing a product's sender
 * reputation, so the only inputs here are a type, a recipient, and typed data.
 *
 * A closed template set was never enough on its own, and this route has now
 * been holed twice for the same underlying reason — that "closed set" was
 * mistaken for "safe". MAIL-1: the templates put a caller-supplied URL behind a
 * "Sign in" button. And, until this change, the recipient was whoever the
 * caller named. Both fixes are marked in place below. The rule to keep: every
 * value that reaches a real inbox must be either written in this repository or
 * checked against something the server verified itself.
 *
 * Returns 400 for anything malformed and 200 for everything else — including a
 * failed send, which is reported as { sent: false, reason } rather than a 500,
 * because "email is off" is the default state of this app, not a server fault.

 * It does not: the `invite` and `magic-link` templates put a CALLER-SUPPLIED
 * URL behind a "Accept invitation" / "Sign in" button, and the endpoint needs
 * no authentication. Anyone could therefore send "Sign in to Qubit16" to
 * any address, from Qubit16's own verified sending domain, pointing at
 * their own credential-harvesting page — a well-aligned, DKIM-signed,
 * SPF-passing phishing mail that no filter will flag.
 *
 * Links in transactional mail must point back at this app. The host allow-list
 * is derived from NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (which defaults to http://localhost:3000,
 * so the zero-config developer flow is unaffected) plus the request's own
 * origin, which is what the org-invite route builds its URLs from.
 *
 * NOTE: `httpUrl` also rejects `javascript:` and `data:` schemes, which the
 * template's HTML-escaping did not — escaping a `javascript:` href produces a
 * perfectly functional `javascript:` href.
