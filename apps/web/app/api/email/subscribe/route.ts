/**
 * /api/email/subscribe — signup and confirmation for the 7-day email course.
 *
 *   POST { email }   → store an UNCONFIRMED consent row, mail a confirm link.
 *   GET  ?token=…    → the click on that link; stamps confirmed_at.
 *
 * This route exists because docs/ONBOARDING.md refuses lifecycle email until
 * a consent record exists. It is prerequisite 1. It is NOT a sender of course
 * content — prerequisite 3 (a scheduler) still does not exist, and the only
 * message this route ever causes is the one confirm mail, to the address that
 * was just submitted, carrying only URLs built from this app's own origin.
 *
 * Read app/api/email/route.ts's header before touching this file: that route
 * was holed twice (MAIL-1, then the recipient hole) by values from the request
 * reaching an inbox. The rules inherited from those fixes:
 *
 *   • No caller-supplied URL ever enters a template. The confirm and
 *     unsubscribe links are built HERE from APP_URL. There is no parameter to
 *     validate because there is no parameter.
 *   • The recipient is the submitted address itself, and the only thing it can
 *     ever be sent is "did you ask for this?". Anyone can submit anyone's
 *     address — that is inherent to a signup form — so the mail must be
 *     harmless-to-strangers by construction, and the rate limit (tighter than
 *     /api/email's) bounds how annoying a griefer can be per IP.
 *   • The response NEVER reveals whether an address was already subscribed:
 *     an already-confirmed signup sends nothing but answers identically, so
 *     this endpoint is not an address-probing oracle and not a primitive for
 *     re-mailing confirmed subscribers.
