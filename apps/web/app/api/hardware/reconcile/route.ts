/**
 * POST /api/hardware/reconcile — one bounded sweep of unobserved hardware jobs.
 *
 * THIS IS A CRON ENDPOINT, NOT A USER ENDPOINT. There is no signed-in path
 * into it and there should never be one: a sweep reads and writes rows
 * belonging to EVERY account, so "the caller is signed in" is not a
 * permission that means anything here. The only credential is an operator
 * secret.
 *
 * ── Why it exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /api/hardware/job/{provider}/{job_id}` is the only thing that has ever
 * observed a hardware job, and it only runs while somebody has the page open.
 * Close the tab and the row stays `queued` forever, however long ago IBM
 * finished it. `lib/hardware/reconcile.ts` has the full account of what the
 * sweep does and — more importantly — what it deliberately cannot do
 * (estimator expectation values, for want of stored observable labels).
 *
 * ── Who may call it ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Authorization: Bearer HARDWARE_RECONCILE_SECRET`, the same shape as
 * `EMAIL_DISPATCH_SECRET` on /api/email/dispatch. Two properties matter and
 * both are easy to get wrong:
 *
 *  · WITH THE VARIABLE UNSET THE ROUTE REFUSES EVERYONE. An empty secret must
 *    never authorise anything — "compare the header to the env var" with an
 *    empty env var is how a cron endpoint ends up open to the internet, and
 *    this one can spend vendor API quota on every account in the table.
 *  · The comparison is constant-time. `===` leaks the secret a byte at a time
 *    to anyone willing to measure a few thousand requests.
 *
 * Read per request rather than at module scope so a test can exercise the
 * unset case and the wrong-secret case in one file without module-cache games.
 *
 * ── Rate limited BEFORE the secret is checked ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A guessing loop should not get cheaper than the limiter, and a sweep is
 * expensive downstream: every allowed call is up to `limit` vendor round
 * trips. The limit is deliberately low — a cron ticking every minute needs
 * one call per minute.
 *
 * ── Idempotency ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two overlapping calls are safe. The sweep only writes fields it actually
 * observed and guards every UPDATE to rows that are still non-terminal, so a
 * slow pass cannot drag a job that a faster pass already finished back to
 * `queued`. Details, and the limits of that guarantee across instances, are in
 * lib/hardware/reconcile.ts.
 *
 * ── How long this may run, which this file does NOT declare ─────────────────
 *
 * The sweep's own budget is 20s and each vendor poll may take 8s, so a pass can
 * want ~28s. NO `maxDuration` IS SET HERE, so the platform's default applies —
 * 10s on Vercel Hobby, 15s on Pro at the time of writing. On such a plan the
 * invocation is killed before the sweep's own deadline fires: the cron sees a
 * platform error, no report is produced, and the operator learns nothing about
 * how far the pass got. Nothing is corrupted (every write is one guarded
 * statement and the next tick simply re-reads the same rows), but the
 * stop-early-and-say-so contract is void.
 *
 * It is left undeclared rather than guessed because the right value depends on
 * the plan this is deployed to. An operator MUST do one of two things: add
 * `export const maxDuration = 60` here, or pass a `limit` and rely on a shorter
 * `deadlineMs`. This is on the wiring checklist, not a decision this file made.
