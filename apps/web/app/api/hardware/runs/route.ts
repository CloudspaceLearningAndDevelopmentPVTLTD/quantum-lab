/**
 * POST /api/hardware/runs — publish one hardware run as a citable permalink.
 *
 * ── What this is for ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A paper needs a reproducibility artefact and currently attaches a GitHub
 * gist. A permalink here carries the circuit, the device, the compilation
 * settings, the raw counts and — the part nobody else keeps — the calibration
 * the device reported at submission time. That last field is what makes a
 * result reproducible rather than merely repeatable: "IBM Brisbane" in 2026 is
 * not the same machine as "IBM Brisbane" in 2027.
 *
 * ── Publishing is irreversible in the way that matters ──────────────────────
 *
 * The row is immutable once written (a trigger in supabase/schema-runs.sql
 * permits exactly one UPDATE, setting `withdrawn_at`), and until it is
 * withdrawn anyone with the link can read it without an account. That is the
 * point of a citation, and it is also why:
 *
 *   * `optIn` has no default anywhere in this path. A default of false lets a
 *     backfill write dead rows; a default of true publishes somebody's data
 *     silently. A required field simply fails, which is the only one of the
 *     three anybody notices.
 *   * The circuit is published VERBATIM, comments included. The UI says so
 *     before the button is pressed.
 *   * The account id, the vendor job id and the owner tag are removed by
 *     `buildPublishedRun` — the job id in particular is a handle into the
 *     owner's own vendor console and has no business in a public record.
 *
 * ── Re-publishing is not an error ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The public id is derived from the source row, so publishing the same run
 * twice produces the same id and the second insert hits a unique violation.
 * That is answered with the existing permalink and a 200, because from the
 * caller's side "it is published, here is the link" is true either way.
