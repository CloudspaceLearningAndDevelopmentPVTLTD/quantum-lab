/**
 * POST /api/hardware/submit — server-side proxy for the same path on
 * `services/api`.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE THAT SPENDS MONEY. Each accepted call enqueues a job on IBM
 * or Braket, and `forward()` presents the operator's shared secret upstream on
 * the caller's behalf.
 *
 * WHOSE money depends on step 4b. By default it is the OPERATOR's vendor
 * allowance, metered by steps 5–6. When the caller has stored their own vendor
 * credential (BYOK, the internal handoff notes §4) it is theirs, the job is recorded but
 * not metered, and steps 5–6 are replaced by `reserveByokJob`. Read the long
 * comment on that function before deciding a gate was skipped by accident.
 *
 * ── The regression this file used to be ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Between the proxy landing and this change, the only gate here was an IP rate
 * limit of 5/minute. That is not a control on a billable endpoint: IP rotation
 * costs a few dollars an hour. Worse, it was a REGRESSION — before the proxy,
 * an operator who set `API_SHARED_SECRET` (the control docs/SECURITY.md §4
 * recommends) got a 401 upstream for browser traffic, so the hardware page was
 * broken but the endpoint that spends money was shut. The proxy then began
 * attaching that secret on behalf of ANY anonymous caller, so turning on the
 * documented lock stopped protecting the only endpoint with a cost attached.
 * `curl -X POST …/api/hardware/submit` from a signed-out client was accepted.
 *
 * The enforcement layer existed the whole time and had zero callers. It has
 * callers now, and `lib/hardware/submitGate.test.ts` fails if they are removed.
 *
 * ── The gate chain, in order, and why each link is where it is ──────────────
 *
 *  1. IP rate limit (SUBMIT_LIMIT). FIRST, before anything expensive, because
 *     step 2 makes a network call to Supabase and an unauthenticated flood must
 *     not be able to turn this route into a load generator against our own auth
 *     service.
 *  2. `requireCaller` → a Supabase-verified user id, or 401. Identity comes from
 *     a token Supabase validated and from nothing else.
 *  3. Per-ACCOUNT rate limit. The IP bucket bounds one machine; this bucket
 *     bounds one account, and an account is not free to rotate.
 *  4. Shape validation. Cheap, and it keeps a malformed body from ever reaching
 *     the billing layer.
 *  4b. `resolveSubmissionCredential` → whose vendor credential pays. A store
 *     failure REFUSES rather than falling back to the operator's credentials:
 *     a user who attached their own token arranged not to spend ours, and
 *     quietly spending it because a lookup failed is an invisible bill.
 *  5. `requireFeature(id, 'hardware.real')` → 402 for Free. A billing-lookup
 *     failure degrades to the free tier, which here means REFUSE — the safe
 *     direction.
 *  6. `reserveHardwareJobWithinBudget` → ONE call to
 *     `public.reserve_hardware_job_within_budget`, which wraps
 *     `public.reserve_hardware_job` (below) and additionally prices the window
 *     against any spending limit on the account, inside the same transaction
 *     and the same advisory lock. With no budget configured it is the plain
 *     reservation plus one no-op comparison. What the inner function does:
 *     counts the window and inserts the reservation under a per-user advisory
 *     lock. `reserved: false` is a 402; nothing was written for it. This
 *     replaces the insert-then-count dance that STATUS.md carried as a known
 *     race: two genuinely simultaneous submissions could both pass a limit only
 *     one of them fitted under.
 *  7. `forward` — and ONLY now does the shared secret leave this process.
 *  8. `recordHardwareJob` stamps the provider's job handle onto the reserved
 *     row, which is what makes the job pollable by its owner and nobody else.
 *     A non-2xx upstream releases the reservation instead.
 *
 * Steps 5–6 are the only thing that makes `lib/plans.ts`'s advertised 50 / 500 /
 * 5,000 hardware jobs a month mean anything. Before this they were marketing.
 *
 * ── What "a month" means here ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The subscription's monthly anniversary, not the calendar month. A customer
 * who subscribes on the 20th would otherwise get the tail of one calendar month
 * plus a full fresh allowance days later — up to double what they paid for, in
 * IBM time the operator buys. lib/billing/period.ts holds the decision and the
 * fallback for accounts with no billing anchor.

/**
 * The upstream said yes and gave us nothing to poll.
 *
 * WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE: the reservation was kept, a line was written to the
 * console, and the upstream's 2xx was passed through unchanged. That is the
 * worst of the three available outcomes. The browser's `submit()` types the
 * body as `SubmittedJob` and the hardware page immediately starts a monitor on
 * `job_id`, so the user got a job card polling `undefined` — a broken card and
 * no way to find out whether their circuit is running. STATUS.md listed it as
 * "logged, not handled".
 *
 * THE DECISION, and the two rejected alternatives:
 *
 *  · REFUND AND REPORT SUCCESS was rejected: the vendor may well have accepted
 *    the job (a 2xx normally means it did), and handing allowance back for
 *    spend we cannot rule out is the expensive direction — the same reasoning
 *    that makes this whole module fail closed.
 *  · PASS THE 2xx THROUGH was rejected: a response that claims success and
 *    omits the only field the caller needs is a lie the UI cannot detect.
 *
 * So: KEEP the usage row, MARK it `settlement = 'unmatched'` so an operator can
 * find it (query 5 in supabase/schema-billing.sql), and answer 502 with copy
 * that tells the user exactly what is true — it may be running, we cannot show
 * it, look in the provider's console. That is an honest answer to an honest
 * mess, and it is actionable by both the user and support.
 *
 * If this fires more than rarely, the bug is upstream in `services/api`'s
 * hardware dispatcher and this route is the wrong place to fix it.
