/**
 * GET /api/health — what this deployment can actually reach.
 *
 * STATUS CODE IS THE CONTRACT, not the body: 200 when everything configured is
 * answering, 503 when something configured is not. An orchestrator, an uptime
 * monitor and a load balancer all read the code and none of them parses JSON,
 * so a health endpoint that returns 200 with `{"status":"failing"}` is a health
 * endpoint that never fires an alert.
 *
 * `degraded` is 200. It means "working, with a caveat" (see the Supabase
 * anon-key-only case in lib/observability/health.ts) and paging on it would
 * teach people to ignore the page.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PUBLISH, because it is unauthenticated and reachable by
 * anyone who can reach the app: no environment-variable values, no internal
 * hostnames or ports, no upstream response bodies, no exception messages, no
 * database or provider error text. Probe detail strings are written by hand in
 * lib/observability/health.ts and reviewed as public copy. What it does publish
 * is which optional integrations exist — that is inherent to a useful health
 * check and is already visible from the app's own behaviour.
 *
 * `?verbose=0` trims the per-check detail to just statuses, for a monitor that
 * only wants the roll-up.
 *
 * ── Cheap by default; the expensive checks are opt-in ───────────────────────
 *
 * This route used to be unauthenticated, unrate-limited, and to perform a live
 * Supabase HEAD count plus two upstream fetches ON EVERY REQUEST. That is a
 * free amplifier: one cheap request from anywhere on the internet became three
 * expensive requests against our own dependencies, with no bound on the rate.
 * A liveness probe that can be used to hammer the database is not a liveness
 * probe. Two things changed:
 *
 *  1. RATE LIMIT. Shallow gets a generous per-IP allowance (a 30s HEALTHCHECK
 *     needs 2/minute; the limit is 60). Deep gets a much smaller one, because
 *     each deep call costs three network round trips.
 *  2. DEEP IS OPT-IN. `?deep=1` runs the real probes. If `HEALTH_DEEP_TOKEN` is
 *     set, deep additionally requires it (`x-health-token:` header, or `token=`
 *     in the query so a monitor that can only be given a URL still works); a
 *     wrong or missing token silently falls back to the shallow report rather
 *     than 401-ing, so this endpoint never becomes an oracle for whether a
 *     token is configured.
 *
 * WHEN NO TOKEN IS CONFIGURED, deep remains open to anyone — bounded by the
 * tight limiter and by nothing else. That is the compatible default (an
 * operator's existing monitor keeps working after this deploy). Setting
 * HEALTH_DEEP_TOKEN is recommended — see docs/SECURITY.md, finding HEALTH-1.
 *
 * Point the orchestrator at `/api/health` and the uptime monitor at
 * `/api/health?deep=1&token=…`. A shallow `ok` means "the process is up and
 * wired", NOT "every dependency answers" — do not alert on it.
