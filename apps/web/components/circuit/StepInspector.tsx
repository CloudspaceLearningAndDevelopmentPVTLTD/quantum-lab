 * cannot connect an algorithm to the state it produces. This control makes the
 * intermediate states the thing you look at.
 *
 * THE STEP MODEL, which is the page's and not a second one:
 *   `step` counts gates APPLIED, so it indexes `frames` directly —
 *   simulateSteps() returns frames[0] = |0…0⟩ then one frame per op, which is
 *   exactly the prefix simulation this needs; nothing is re-simulated here and
 *   no op list is sliced.
 *   `step === null` means "not stepping — showing the end", which is the state
 *   page.tsx starts in and returns to after any edit. It is rendered as the
 *   last step rather than as a separate mode, so the transport always has a
 *   position; the only visible difference is that the grid draws no column
 *   highlight, which is right — no single gate is current.
 *
 * Driving the page's own `stepIndex` (rather than holding a second cursor) is
 * what guarantees the grid's violet column and this readout can never disagree.
