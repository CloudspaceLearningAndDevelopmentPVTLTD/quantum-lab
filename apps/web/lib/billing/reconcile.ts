/**
 * reconcile.ts — re-derive an account's entitlement from Stripe, on demand.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY: service-role client plus the Stripe secret key.
 *
 * ── Why a pull path exists at all ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The webhook is a PUSH, and a push is not a guarantee. Every one of these has
 * happened to somebody:
 *
 *  · The endpoint was down, or `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` was rotated and not
 *    redeployed, so every delivery 400'd for a while. Stripe gives up after
 *    about three days of retries and the change is gone.
 *  · The subscription was edited in the Stripe DASHBOARD — a support refund, a
 *    coupon, a manual plan change, a cancellation on the customer's behalf.
 *    Those do emit events, but they also happen at exactly the times an
 *    operator is least likely to be watching a webhook log.
 *  · The webhook endpoint was not subscribed to an event type it needed.
 *  · `metadata.userId` was missing, so the event was verified, acknowledged and
 *    unattributable (the handler logs and moves on, deliberately — retrying
 *    cannot invent the id).
 *
 * The result is the same in each case: Stripe thinks one thing, we bill and
 * gate on another. This module makes Stripe authoritative again in one call.
 *
 * ── WHEN THIS SHOULD RUN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. AUTOMATICALLY, when the row is provably stale. `GET /api/billing/
 *    entitlement` triggers it when `current_period_end` is more than a day in
 *    the past: a renewal that happened at the provider and never reached us.
 *    That is the case where a paying customer is being denied what they paid
 *    for, and it self-heals on their next page load. Bounded by a per-process
 *    cooldown (RECONCILE_COOLDOWN_MS) so a hot loop cannot turn into a Stripe
 *    rate-limit incident.
 * 2. ON DEMAND, `POST /api/billing/reconcile` — a signed-in user reconciling
 *    themselves ("I upgraded and it still says Free" is the single most common
 *    billing ticket, and this is its self-service answer), or an operator with
 *    the shared secret reconciling any user id.
 * 3. NIGHTLY, for every account with a `stripe_customer_id`, from cron. Not
 *    wired here: this repository has no scheduler and inventing one that never
 *    runs is exactly the kind of decoration this project has been burned by.
 *    docs/BILLING.md §8 gives the loop and the curl.
 * 4. AFTER ANY WEBHOOK OUTAGE, for everyone. Same loop as (3).
 *
 * A reconciliation writes with a null event stamp, which
 * `apply_stripe_subscription` treats as "unconditionally fresh" — it read the
 * live object, so it cannot be stale relative to any event. The one ordering
 * hazard that leaves is an in-flight event applied a moment later with an older
 * `created`; it will be dropped as stale, and dropping it is correct, because
 * the live read already includes whatever it was going to say.
