/**
 * email/courseSchedule.ts — which course day is due, as arithmetic.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: no store, no clock, no environment. The dispatch route
 * (app/api/email/dispatch) supplies a subscription row and "now", and this
 * module answers one question — "which day of the 7-day course, if any,
 * should be sent to this subscriber right now?" — so the answer is testable
 * without a database and identical however it is invoked.
 *
 * ── The schedule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Day N becomes due at confirmed_at + (N−1) × 24h. Day 1 is due the moment
 * the confirmation is clicked. The launch doc asks for "07:00 local"; the
 * server cannot know a subscriber's timezone from an email address, so the
 * delivery HOUR is set by when the operator runs dispatch (the schedule they
 * put it on), and this module only guarantees "never early": day N is not
 * offered before N−1 whole days have passed since confirmation.
 *
 * ── Idempotency and catch-up ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `sentDays` is the send record (the sent_days column on the subscription
 * row). dueCourseDay returns the LOWEST unsent day that is due, so:
 *   • a day already in sentDays is never offered again — a re-run of
 *     dispatch after a crash sends nothing twice;
 *   • a backlog (subscriber confirmed a week ago, dispatch just switched on)
 *     drains ONE message per dispatch run, in order, never a seven-mail
 *     burst into one inbox.
 * Days are always offered in order: day 3 is not sendable while day 2 is
 * unsent, even if both are due.
