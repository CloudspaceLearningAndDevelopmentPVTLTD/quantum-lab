/**
 * env.ts — the authoritative list of every environment variable the Next app
 * reads, and the startup check that reports on them.
 *
 * The list below was derived by grepping `apps/web` for `process.env.` and
 * following each hit to the code that consumes it, not by copying a document.
 * If you add a `process.env.X` anywhere under `apps/web`, add it here too —
 * `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `.env.example` are both written from this table.
 *
 * ## Why the `required` list is empty
 *
 * It is not an oversight and it is not laziness. This app is built so that an
 * entirely empty environment produces a working deployment: the lesson track,
 * the circuit simulator, the eight visualizations, the exams and the offline
 * tutor are self-contained TypeScript with no external dependency. Every
 * variable here switches on an *extra*, and every consumer of one is written to
 * degrade rather than throw (see `lib/supabase.ts`, `lib/billing/stripe.ts`,
 * `lib/email/client.ts`).
 *
 * So `assertEnv()` has nothing to fail on from absence alone. What it *does*
 * fail on is a half-configuration — a combination that cannot work and that
 * fails silently in production, where "silently" means the operator finds out
 * from a support email weeks later. Those are the `PAIRS` rules below. That is
 * the fail-loud-and-early path, and it is the one worth having.
 *
 * Do not "fix" this by marking things required. A change that makes an empty
 * environment fail to boot breaks the property the whole project is built on.
 *
 * ## Where this runs
 *
 * `instrumentation.ts` calls `assertEnv()` in its `register()` hook.
 * `next.config.mjs` sets `experimental.instrumentationHook` unconditionally
 * (not only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is present), so Next 14 always loads
 * `instrumentation.ts` and this check runs on every deployment, Sentry or not.
 * `node scripts/preflight.mjs` covers the same ground before a deploy and needs
 * no build, for the pre-deploy path.
 *
 * ## Build time vs run time
 *
 * `scope: 'build'` is load-bearing, not documentation. `next.config.mjs` has an
 * `env: { NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL }` block, and every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` name is
 * inlined into the compiled output by the compiler. Their values are frozen at
 * `next build`. Changing one in a dashboard, a `docker run -e`, or a compose
 * `environment:` block does nothing at all — verified by grepping the committed
 * build output: `.next/server/app/hardware/page.js` and
 * `.next/server/middleware.js` both contain the literal `http://localhost:8000`
 * baked in from the build machine. A rebuild is the only way to change them.
 */
