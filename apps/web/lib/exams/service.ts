/**
 * service.ts — everything the exam route handlers actually do.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY.
 *
 * The route files under `app/api/exams/**` are deliberately thin: parse, call
 * one function here, serialise. The gates live in this file so that "what does
 * it take to get a paper" and "what does it take to get a certificate" are two
 * functions someone can read end to end, rather than four handlers that have to
 * be diffed against each other.
 *
 * ── The chain, and why each link is where it is ─────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. Rate limit, keyed on the caller. Before any Supabase round trip, so an
 *     anonymous flood cannot turn these routes into a load generator against
 *     our own auth service. (Same reasoning as /api/hardware/submit.)
 *  2. `resolveSubject` — a Supabase-verified user, or a guest cookie. Identity
 *     never comes from a body. There is no `userId` parameter anywhere in this
 *     file, and there must never be one.
 *  3. `requireFeature` for an exam that declares `requiresFeature`. This is the
 *     first time the `certification` FeatureId has meant anything: the check
 *     used to be a client component, i.e. decoration. A guest resolves to the
 *     free plan, so the advanced paper is refused before a question is drawn.
 *  4. Ownership. Every attempt operation re-reads the attempt and compares its
 *     `subjectId` to the resolved subject. An attempt id is a bearer token
 *     otherwise.
 *  5. The server clock. `expiresAt` was stamped at creation; a write that
 *     arrives after it plus `SUBMIT_GRACE_MS` is refused, and the attempt is
 *     closed with the answers that arrived in time.
 *
 * ── What is NOT trusted from the request ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `score`, `passed`, `submittedAt`, `startedAt`, `questionIds`, `certificateId`
 * and the subject. If a body contains any of them they are ignored — the
 * submit handler reads only `attemptId` and `answers`, and the score is
 * recomputed from the bank every time. `lib/exams/attemptRoutes.test.ts` posts
 * a body claiming a perfect score and asserts the stored attempt disagrees.

/**
 * The key these limits may safely be counted under.
 *
 * SECURITY FIX. Passing `resolved.subject.id` unconditionally made every one of
 * these limits unenforceable against exactly the caller they exist to bound.
 * `resolveSubject` MINTS a fresh `guest_<128 bits>` for a request that carries
 * no cookie, so an anonymous caller was handed a brand-new rate-limit bucket on
 * every single request: `callerKey` saw a truthy subject, keyed on it, and the
 * counter it incremented was one nobody would ever look at again. Measured
 * against the running app before this change: fourteen consecutive
 * `POST /api/exams/foundations-cert/attempt` from one IP with no cookie
 * returned fourteen 201s and created fourteen `exam_attempts` rows, against a
 * documented limit of ten a minute. The same fourteen requests carrying one
 * fixed guest cookie were refused from the eleventh, which is the limiter
 * working — it was only ever the freshly-minted identity that escaped it.
 *
 * "Only key on it once the caller has PRESENTED the cookie" is not enough
 * either, and it is worth saying why so nobody weakens this back to it: a guest
 * id is `guest_` + 32 hex, unsigned, self-asserted and never checked against
 * anything (session.ts says so, correctly — it protects nothing). A caller who
 * mints their own cookie value per request presents a cookie every time and is
 * still in a fresh bucket every time.
 *
 * So the rule is the only one that holds: A RATE LIMIT MAY ONLY BE KEYED ON AN
 * IDENTITY THE SERVER VERIFIED. That is a Supabase-checked account id and
 * nothing else. Guests fall back to the address, which is what `callerKey` does
 * for a null subject — weak, rotatable, and honestly described in the header of
 * lib/rateLimit.ts, but it is a bound, and the guest id was not one.
