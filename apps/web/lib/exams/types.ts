/**
 * types.ts — the data model for the certification exam engine.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `lib/lessons/types.ts`: a lesson quiz is a
 * teaching device that reveals its answer immediately, whereas an exam question
 * is graded in bulk at the end and carries a point weight.
 *
 * ── The one distinction that matters in this file ───────────────────────────
 *
 *   `ExamQuestion`  is the SERVER's question. It carries `correctIds` /
 *                   `correctNumber` / `tolerance` and the `explanation`.
 *                   It is only ever constructed in `questions.ts`, which
 *                   refuses to load in a browser.
 *
 *   `PaperQuestion` is the CANDIDATE's question. Structurally it cannot hold
 *                   an answer key: the fields do not exist on the type, and
 *                   `toPaperQuestion` in `engine.ts` builds it field by field
 *                   rather than by spreading, so a new key added to
 *                   `ExamQuestion` does not silently ride along.
 *
 * Anything sent to the browser during a sitting is typed `PaperQuestion`. The
 * answer key reaches the browser exactly once — in the graded review, after the
 * server has closed the attempt, and only for the questions that were on that
 * candidate's paper.
