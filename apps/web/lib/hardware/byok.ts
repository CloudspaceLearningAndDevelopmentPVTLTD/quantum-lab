/**
 * hardware/byok.ts — deciding WHOSE credential pays for one hardware request.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. It reaches the credential store, which decrypts vendor secrets.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own module ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two routes have to reach the same answer about the same job, and they reach
 * it from different information:
 *
 *   · `POST /api/hardware/submit` knows the backend id and an OPTIONAL
 *     provider (the hardware page omits it and lets the upstream derive it).
 *   · `GET  /api/hardware/job/{provider}/{jobId}` knows the provider and
 *     nothing else.
 *
 * If they disagree the failure is quiet. A job is invisible outside the account
 * that created it — on every vendor, not just IBM — so a submit that uses the
 * credential and a poll that does not produces a job that runs fine and then
 * reports "not found" forever. One module, one decision, both callers.
