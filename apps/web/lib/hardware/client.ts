/**
 * client.ts — the typed fetch client for the Python hardware API.
 *
 * Design rule: THIS MODULE NEVER THROWS AND NEVER HANGS.
 *
 * In local development the Python service is usually not running, and that is
 * the expected case rather than a fault. So every call returns a discriminated
 * `Result<T>` and every request is bounded by an AbortController timeout — a
 * promise that never settles would leave the UI spinning forever, which is a
 * worse outcome than any error message.
 *
 * `offline` distinguishes "nothing answered on the socket" (start the API) from
 * "the API answered with a 4xx/5xx" (read the message); the UI shows very
 * different copy for the two.
 *
 * ── The calls now go through the Next server ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every endpoint the app uses is fetched from a same-origin route under
 * `/api/hardware/*`, which forwards to `services/api` and attaches the shared
 * secret when one is configured. See lib/hardware/proxy.ts. The browser never
 * talks to the Python service directly, which is what made the opt-in
 * `API_SHARED_SECRET` unusable before (docs/SECURITY.md §4, step 3).
 *
 * The user-visible behaviour is unchanged. Error messages still name
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` rather than the proxy, because when the hardware page
 * says "could not reach it, run `uvicorn app.main:app`" the useful host to name
 * is the Python one. The proxy reports an unreachable upstream as a 504 with
 * `offline: true` in the body, which `request()` folds back into the same
 * offline Result the browser used to build from its own thrown fetch.
 *
 * ── The calls carry the caller's session token ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `/api/hardware/submit` spends the operator's money and `/api/hardware/job/*`
 * returns somebody's measurement results, so both now require a Supabase-
 * verified caller (see the gate chains in those route files). The token is
 * attached by `lib/authFetch.ts` — the ONE place in the app that reads the
 * session and shapes the `Authorization: Bearer …` header the routes parse.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL PLUMBING. Adding the server-side gate without this line
 * would 401 every paying customer while leaving `curl` exactly as refused, i.e.
 * it would break the product and fix nothing for the people who matter. When
 * nobody is signed in, `authFetch` sends no header at all and the route answers
 * 401 with copy the page renders — which is the correct outcome, not a bug.
