/**
 * proxy.ts — the SERVER half of the hardware client. Never import from a
 * component; it reads a secret out of the environment.
 *
 * Why this exists: `lib/hardware/client.ts` used to call `services/api`
 * straight from the browser using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. That is the single
 * reason the opt-in `API_SHARED_SECRET` in `services/api/app/core/security.py`
 * could not be switched on — a browser cannot be given the secret (a secret in
 * a bundle is not a secret), so enabling the gate returned 401 to the hardware
 * page. docs/SECURITY.md §4 step 3 asks for exactly this module.
 *
 * ── The contract this module must not break ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * With NO secret configured the observable behaviour of the hardware page is
 * unchanged: same upstream host, same paths, same status codes, same response
 * bodies, same error text. The only difference is that the bytes take one extra
 * hop through the Next server. Local development is therefore untouched — and
 * must stay untouched, because `services/api` is normally not running at all
 * during local development and the page's "the API is not up, here is the
 * command" state is a designed state, not a fault.
 *
 * ── Surface ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only the endpoints the app and the public API actually call are forwarded:
 *
 *   GET    /api/hardware/devices
 *   POST   /api/hardware/estimate
 *   POST   /api/hardware/transpile
 *   POST   /api/hardware/recommend       (ranks devices; spends nothing)
 *   POST   /api/circuits/resources       (FT resource estimate; pure arithmetic)
 *   POST   /api/hardware/submit          (sampler AND estimator)
 *   GET    /api/hardware/job/{provider}/{job_id}
 *   POST   /api/hardware/session         (reserves a device — spends money)
 *   DELETE /api/hardware/session/{id}
 *
 * `GET /api/hardware/jobs` is NOT in this list and is not a proxy: it reads
 * this account's stored job history out of our own database.
 *
 * This is NOT a catch-all `[...path]` proxy, deliberately. `services/api` also
 * exposes `/api/circuits/run` (executes arbitrary user QASM) and `/api/jobs`
 * (a job queue). A wildcard proxy would republish every one of them through
 * the Next server and quietly undo whatever the secret was protecting. If you
 * need another endpoint, add another route file and validate its shape too.

 * line of gates. The identity comes from a credential the server verified and
 * from nothing else — never from a `userId` in the body, which is a claim.
 *
 * ── Two credentials, one identity ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the surface where a SCRIPT is a first-class caller, so it accepts
 * either a Supabase session token (a browser) or a `qb16_sk_…` API key (a
 * script, a CI job, a notebook). `verifiedApiCaller` tries them in that order.
 *
 * The rest of the app does NOT do this and must not start: billing, orgs,
 * exams and the platform console all still call `verifiedCallerId`, which
 * accepts a session and nothing else. A credential living in a CI environment
 * variable must not be able to change the subscription it spends against.
 *
 * ── Scopes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `scope` is what this route needs. A session caller always has it — a person
 * signed into the site is exercising the full authority of their own account.
 * A key has it only if it was issued with it, and is refused with a 403 that
 * names the missing scope, so the fix is obvious from the error alone.
 *
 * ── An unverifiable key is a refusal ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * When a key was presented and the store could not answer, this returns 503
 * rather than 401. "We cannot check your credential" is not "you are
 * anonymous", and the difference is what stops a database blip from reading to
 * a script as a permanent auth failure it should stop retrying.
 *
 * The 401 body uses `detail`, not `error`, because `lib/hardware/client.ts`
 * reads FastAPI's `{ detail }` shape and the hardware page renders it. A 401
