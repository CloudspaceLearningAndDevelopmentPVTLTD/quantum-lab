/**
 * reconcile.test.ts — the background sweep, and the four ways it could be
 * worse than not having it at all.
 *
 * FAKED: the service-role Supabase client and `lib/hardware/proxy`'s upstream
 * call. REAL: every decision this module makes — which rows it asks for, what
 * it is willing to write onto them, what it reports about the rows it did not
 * reach, and who the route lets in.
 *
 * The failures these tests exist to catch, each of which is silent:
 *
 *  1. A capped batch reported as a finished one. "polled 50, everything is
 *     reconciled" while nine hundred rows sit untouched is worse than no
 *     sweep, because it is a sweep an operator believes.
 *  2. A queued poll erasing a finished job's counts. The sweep runs
 *     unattended over every account's rows, so the blast radius of a null
 *     written over a histogram is the whole table, and nobody is watching.
 *  3. A cron endpoint that runs for a caller with the wrong secret — or, the
 *     classic, that runs for EVERYONE because the secret was never configured
 *     and an empty string compares equal to an empty header.
 *  4. Two overlapping passes both spending a vendor round trip on the same
 *     job, and the slower one dragging a finished job back to `queued`.
