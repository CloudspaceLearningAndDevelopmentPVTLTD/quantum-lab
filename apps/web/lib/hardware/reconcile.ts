/**
 * reconcile.ts — sweep hardware jobs whose last observed state is stale.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. Never import this from a client component: it builds the
 * service-role Supabase client and it presents the upstream shared secret.
 *
 * ── The hole this fills ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `GET /api/hardware/job/{provider}/{job_id}` is the ONLY thing on this
 * platform that has ever observed a hardware job. Submission is asynchronous
 * at the vendor and nothing calls us back, so the job's row in
 * `public.hardware_usage` only learns what happened if a browser tab is open
 * and polling when it happens. Submit a circuit, close the tab, and the row
 * says `queued` for as long as the row exists — however long ago IBM actually
 * finished it. `components/hardware/JobHistory` renders that honestly as
 * "never checked" rather than guessing, which is the right call for a
 * renderer and no fix at all for the data.
 *
 * This module is the fix: find the rows nobody is watching, ask the vendor,
 * write down the answer.
 *
 * ── What it deliberately does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EXPECTATION VALUES ARE NOT RECONCILED. An Estimator job's numbers are
 * meaningless without the observable labels in submission order — IBM stores
 * the operators but not our names for them, which is why the poll route
 * accepts `?observables=` from the caller, who is the only party that has
 * them. WE DO NOT STORE THOSE LABELS ANYWHERE (there is no column for them on
 * `hardware_usage`, and none for the values either). So an estimator job is
 * reconciled to its STATUS and nothing more, and the report counts those rows
 * separately so an operator can see that a class of job is being half-served.
 * The rejected alternative was synthesising positional labels ("obs_0",
 * "obs_1"): that would produce a stored record that looks like a result and
 * cannot be matched back to the Hamiltonian terms it came from, which is worse
 * than an honest gap. Fixing this properly needs a column — see the note at
 * the bottom of this file.
 *
 * A 404 FROM THE VENDOR IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN as an error. A job id the vendor
 * no longer serves and an upstream that is misconfigured for five minutes look
 * identical from here, and recording the second one as a permanent `error`
 * would destroy a real result. Those rows are counted as `unreachable` and
 * left exactly as they were.
 *
 * NO WEBHOOK IS FIRED. The poll route dispatches `hardware_job_finished`
 * through lib/integrations/webhooks when it observes a terminal state; this
 * sweep does NOT, so a user with an integration configured is notified about
 * exactly the jobs they were already watching and not about the ones this
 * module exists for. That is backwards, and it is a gap rather than a
 * decision: wiring it needs `user_id` back in SWEEP_COLUMNS and a deliberate
 * answer to the first-sweep problem (the first pass after this ships will find
 * every historical `queued` row at once and would notify for jobs that
 * finished weeks ago, bounded only by the batch limit). Left unwired rather
 * than shipped quietly, because a burst of stale notifications is worse than a
 * documented silence.
 *
 * THE WALL-CLOCK BUDGET BELOW IS NOT ENFORCED BY THE PLATFORM. See
 * DEFAULT_DEADLINE_MS: if the hosting platform's function timeout is shorter
 * than the budget, the invocation is killed and no report is produced at all,
 * which is the outcome the budget was meant to avoid.
 *
 * ── Overlap safety (two crons, or a cron and a retry) ───────────────────────
 *
 * Three independent guards, because a sweep is the easiest thing in a codebase
 * to accidentally run twice:
 *
 *  1. The patch only ever carries fields that were actually observed. This is
 *     `recordHardwareResult`'s rule in lib/billing/usage.ts and it is copied
 *     here on purpose — a `counts: null` written by a poll that saw `queued`
 *     would erase the histogram of a job that has already finished.
 *  2. Every UPDATE is guarded to rows that are still non-terminal. So if run B
 *     wrote `done` while run A was in flight, A's late `queued` matches zero
 *     rows instead of dragging the job backwards.
 *  3. An in-process set of jobs currently being polled, so two overlapping
 *     runs IN THE SAME PROCESS do not both spend a vendor round trip on the
 *     same job. Across instances this is at-least-once, not at-most-once, and
 *     guard 2 is what makes that harmless rather than corrupting.

 * does NOT mean "unobserved for a minute": a job a browser tab is actively
 * polling right now is swept anyway, one minute after it was submitted, and
 * the sweep and the tab poll it in parallel for as long as it runs. That costs
 * a duplicated vendor round trip per cron tick per watched job; it cannot
 * corrupt anything (both writers obey the observed-fields-only and
 * non-terminal-guard rules) and it is the price of having no `reconciled_at`.

 *
 *  · The budget is checked BETWEEN polls, never inside one, so a pass can
 *    overrun it by up to one `forward` timeout (8s) before it stops.
 *  · It is only a promise against the PLATFORM's timeout if the platform
 *    allows at least 28s. This route declares no `maxDuration`, and a serverless
 *    default below that (Vercel Hobby is 10s) kills the invocation before this
 *    check ever fires — the cron then gets a platform error instead of a
 *    report, and the rows are simply left for the next tick. Nothing is
 *    corrupted by that (every write is a single guarded statement), but the

/*
 * ── The column this module wants and does not have ──────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. `observable_labels text[]` on `hardware_usage`, stamped by the submit
 *    route for an estimator job. Without it this sweep can never reconcile an
 *    expectation value, only its status, and the report says so on every pass.
 *    (A place to PUT the values is a second column, or a second table.)
 * 2. `reconciled_at timestamptz`, so a pass can back off from a row it has
 *    just polled instead of relying on STALE_FLOOR_DAYS to keep unresolvable
 *    rows from monopolising the batch. With it, the ordering becomes "least
 *    recently checked" and the floor can go.
 *
 * Both are schema changes, and this module was written under a rule that it
 * may not touch the schema. They are listed here rather than left as a comment
 * in someone's head.
