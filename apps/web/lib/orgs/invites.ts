/**
 * orgs/invites.ts — invite tokens for seat handover.
 *
 * ############################################################
 * #  THE SCHEME, AND WHY THIS ONE                            #
 * #                                                          #
 * #  SECURITY FIX (audit finding INV-1). What was here       #
 * #  before was a DETERMINISTIC, REVERSIBLE encoding of the  #
 * #  org id and the invitee's email with a djb2 checksum:    #
 * #  anyone could mint a valid token for any (org, email)    #
 * #  pair in two lines of JavaScript and claim a seat on a   #
 * #  stranger's licence. Its own header said so.             #
 * #                                                          #
 * #  Replaced with: a 32-byte CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY RANDOM       #
 * #  token, STORED ONLY AS A SHA-256 HASH, with an EXPIRY    #
 * #  and SINGLE USE.                                         #
 * #                                                          #
 * #  The alternative the audit offered was an HMAC over      #
 * #  (org, email, expiry) with a server secret. It was not   #
 * #  chosen, for three reasons:                              #
 * #                                                          #
 * #   1. SINGLE USE is the property that matters most here.  #
 * #      An invite link travels by email and gets forwarded, #
 * #      logged by mail scanners and pasted into chat. A     #
 * #      stateless HMAC is replayable by everyone who ever   #
 * #      sees it, until it expires. Making it single-use     #
 * #      needs a row to burn — at which point the row exists #
 * #      and the HMAC has bought nothing.                    #
 * #   2. An HMAC needs a server secret. Qubit16 runs     #
 * #      with an entirely empty environment by design, so an #
 * #      unset secret would have to either disable invites   #
 * #      or fall back to something weaker — and a scheme     #
 * #      that is secure only when an optional variable is    #
 * #      set is the failure mode this audit keeps finding.   #
 * #   3. `public.org_invites` already exists, already has an #
 * #      `accepted_at` column, and is already read on the    #
 * #      acceptance path. The row is not a new cost.         #
 * #                                                          #
 * #  Consequences to know about:                             #
 * #   · The token says NOTHING. It is an opaque lookup key,  #
 * #     so the org and email must be read from the stored    #
 * #     row. There is no offline "decode the link" path any  #
 * #     more, and there must not be — that path WAS the      #
 * #     vulnerability.                                       #
 * #   · The raw token exists exactly once, in the response   #
 * #     that mints it. It is never stored, never logged and  #
 * #     cannot be recovered. Losing it means sending a new   #
 * #     invite, which is the correct behaviour.              #

 * is missing — a weak random number here is the whole bug, so this throws
