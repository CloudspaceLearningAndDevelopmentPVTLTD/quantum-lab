/**
 * rateLimit.ts — a fixed-window limiter that counts in a SHARED store.
 *
 * This exists because `lib/security/ratelimit.ts` counts in one Node process's
 * memory, and the routes it guards (`/api/agent`, `/api/email`, the Stripe
 * checkout and portal routes) all spend money per accepted request. On Vercel
 * every cold start begins with an empty map and concurrent invocations do not
 * share one, so a per-instance counter approaches "no limit at all" under
 * exactly the load you would want to limit. That is not a control; this is an
 * attempt at one.
 *
 * ── Which store you get ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL + UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN   → Redis, shared
 *   KV_REST_API_URL        + KV_REST_API_TOKEN          → Redis, shared
 *   neither                                             → in-process, NOT shared
 *
 * The two variable pairs are the same thing: Vercel KV is Upstash underneath
 * and speaks the identical REST dialect, so one code path serves both. The
 * REST protocol is plain `fetch` — no dependency is added to package.json,
 * which matters because this module is imported by route handlers that must
 * keep building in an empty environment.
 *
 * Supabase is the other shared store this project already has, and it is NOT
 * used here on purpose: an atomic counter needs a table plus a `security
 * definer` increment function, and `supabase/schema*.sql` has never been run
 * against a live project (see docs/SECURITY.md, "Could not be verified"). A
 * limiter that depends on unverified SQL is a limiter you cannot trust. If you
 * add that migration, add a Supabase backend here behind the same interface.
 *
 * ── What this bounds, and what it does not ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The key is the caller's IP (see `callerKey`), so this bounds ONE MACHINE.
 * IP rotation is cheap — a residential proxy pool costs a few dollars an hour
 * and any cloud provider will hand out fresh addresses for free — so a
 * determined attacker multiplies the limit by however many addresses they care
 * to buy. IPv6 is normalised to a /64 because a single ISP customer is
 * routinely handed the whole /64 and rotating inside it costs nothing at all;
 * that closes the cheapest rotation and none of the others.
 *
 * So: this stops a script, a runaway client and a bored visitor. It does not
 * stop a distributed attacker, and it must not be described as if it does. The
 * only thing that actually bounds cost per PERSON is authentication plus a
 * per-account quota, and the tutor is deliberately anonymous — that is a
 * product decision, and until it changes this is the ceiling.
