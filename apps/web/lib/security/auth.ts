 * The rule it exists to enforce: IDENTITY COMES FROM A VERIFIED TOKEN AND
 * NOTHING ELSE. A `userId` in a JSON body or a query string is a claim, never a
 * credential — every handler here compares such a value against the id returned

/**
 * Who is calling, when a key is an acceptable credential.
 *
 * ── THIS IS OPT-IN PER ROUTE, AND MUST STAY THAT WAY ────────────────────────
 *
 * `verifiedCaller` and `verifiedCallerId` above are unchanged and still accept
 * a Supabase session token and nothing else. Making THEM accept keys would
 * have been one line and would have silently extended key authority to every
 * route in the app — billing, the customer portal, org membership, exam
 * attempts, the platform admin console. A credential that sits in a CI
 * environment variable must not be able to change the subscription it spends
 * against or alter who is in an organisation.
 *
 * So a route that wants to be scriptable calls THIS function, and the set of
 * such routes is a decision somebody makes on purpose. Today it is the
 * `/api/hardware/*` surface.
 *
 * ── Precedence ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A session token is tried first. Only when that fails is the same bearer
 * value tried as a key, and the structural check in `verifyApiKey` (the
 * `qb16_sk_` prefix) means a JWT never reaches the database as a candidate
 * key, and a key is never sent to Supabase's token verifier twice.
 *
 * ── Failure is a refusal, not a fallthrough ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `verifyApiKey` throws `ApiKeyStoreError` when the store cannot answer, and
 * this function lets it propagate rather than returning null. A caller
 * presenting a key during a database outage must get "we cannot tell" and not
 * "you are anonymous" — the same fail-closed rule `lib/billing/usage.ts`
 * applies to the quota. Routes turn it into a 503.
 *
 * @param req The incoming request.
 * @returns The caller and how they authenticated, or null when neither
 *   credential is valid.
 * @throws ApiKeyStoreError When a key was presented and could not be checked.
