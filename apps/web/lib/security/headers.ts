/**
 * headers.ts — the single source of truth for Qubit16's response headers.
 *
 * The policy is built as DATA (a directive -> sources map) and serialised once,
 * so a directive can be read, diffed and unit-tested instead of being buried in
 * a string blob that nobody dares touch.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OVERLAP WITH vercel.json
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * vercel.json already sets FOUR headers on `/(.*)`:
 *
 *     X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
 *     Referrer-Policy:        strict-origin-when-cross-origin
 *     X-Frame-Options:        SAMEORIGIN
 *     Permissions-Policy:     camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(),
 *                             payment=(), usb=(), interest-cohort=()
 *
 * Those apply only on Vercel. Self-hosting (`next start`, the Dockerfile,
 * docker-compose) gets nothing from them at all, which is why the same headers
 * are set here, in middleware, where they apply on every deployment target.
 *
 * The two MUST NOT DIVERGE, so the four values below are byte-identical to
 * vercel.json's. That is deliberate:
 *
 *   • On Vercel the platform applies its headers to the response middleware
 *     produced. For a single-valued header the last writer wins, and since the
 *     values are identical, "which one wins" is not a question anyone has to
 *     answer. If they ever differ, VERCEL.JSON WINS (it is applied by the edge
 *     network after the function returns) — so a change made only here would
 *     silently do nothing in production. Change both, or neither.
 *   • `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and CSP `frame-ancestors 'self'` are
 *     equivalent statements, and are kept equivalent on purpose. A browser that
 *     understands both applies frame-ancestors and ignores XFO; an older one
 *     applies XFO. Setting `frame-ancestors 'none'` here while vercel.json says
 *     SAMEORIGIN would be a genuine conflict — same-origin framing would work
 *     on one deployment and not another — so it is not done.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THERE IS NO SCRIPT NONCE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A nonce must be unique per RESPONSE and must appear both in the header and in
 * the HTML. Nearly every page in this app is statically prerendered at build
 * time (`next build` emits static HTML for /, /learn/*, /visualizations/*, the
 * lesson and challenge pages...) and that HTML — including Next's inline
 * bootstrap and flight-payload scripts — is written once and served to everyone.
 * A per-request nonce injected by middleware would not match the nonce baked
 * into that static HTML, so every inline script would be BLOCKED and the app
 * would fail to hydrate.
 *
 * The alternatives were:
 *   (a) Nonce everything, and convert the whole app to dynamic rendering. That
 *       is a performance and architecture change, not a security fix, and it is
 *       out of scope for an audit.
 *   (b) Ship `script-src 'none'`-adjacent strictness that silently breaks the
 *       app the first time someone deploys it.
 *   (c) Ship a CSP with `'unsafe-inline'` on script-src, be explicit that this
 *       is the weakest part of the policy, and get the value that remains:
 *       `default-src 'self'` plus a closed `connect-src` still stops an
 *       injected script from loading remote code or beaconing data to an
 *       attacker's host, and `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'` and
 *       `form-action 'self'` still close three real injection paths.
 *
 * (c) is what ships. THE TRADE-OFF IS REAL: with `'unsafe-inline'` on scripts,
 * this CSP is a defence-in-depth layer against exfiltration, not a defence
 * against XSS execution. The app's actual anti-XSS control is that it renders
 * everything — including LLM output — through React text nodes and uses
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` nowhere (verified: zero occurrences in the repo).
 * Moving to a nonce is tracked in docs/SECURITY.md's pre-production checklist.

 * Ancestors allowed to FRAME the /embed/* routes, beyond 'self'.

 * extra ancestors = the embed routes get exactly the global `'self'` policy,
 * so the zero-config path stays as strict as before this variable existed.
 *
 * Each entry is normalised through `new URL().origin` exactly like

 * degrade to a STRICTER policy (the entry is dropped), never to a malformed
 * directive. Wildcards are therefore impossible to express here — that is a
 * feature, not a gap: frame-ancestors is the header that decides who may put
 * this app inside their page, and "anyone" is not an answer this file accepts.
 *
 * WHY X-Frame-Options IS NOT TOUCHED: vercel.json (and this file, kept
 * byte-identical — see the top note) says `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` on
 * every route, and on Vercel the edge applies vercel.json AFTER middleware, so
 * a per-route XFO carve-out here would silently do nothing in production —
 * exactly the divergence the top note forbids. Instead this relies on the
 * precedence the top note already documents: a browser that understands both
 * headers applies frame-ancestors and IGNORES XFO, so widening frame-ancestors
 * on the embed routes is sufficient for every browser shipped since ~2016. A
 * legacy browser falls back to XFO's SAMEORIGIN and refuses the cross-origin
 * frame — which fails STRICT, the safe direction. docs/EMBED.md states this
 * trade-off to integrators.
