/**
 * security/providerCredentials.ts — BYOK: the vendor credential a USER brings.
 *
 * SERVER ONLY. Never import from a client component: it reads the service-role
 * key and it decrypts vendor credentials.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every hardware job used to spend the OPERATOR's IBM/AWS/Azure allowance.
 * That is the one cost on this platform that scales with users, and it is the
 * reason the monthly job quota exists at all. When a researcher supplies their
 * own credential instead:
 *
 *   · their jobs cost this platform nothing;
 *   · the quota stops being a limit worth arguing about for them;
 *   · "free for everyone" becomes structurally true rather than a promotion;
 *   · a lab with its own paid IBM instance, AWS account or Azure workspace can
 *     drive hardware it already pays for through this front end.
 *
 * the internal handoff notes §4 is the specification; docs/BYOK.md is what a user reads.
 *
 * ── ENCRYPTED, NOT HASHED — and why that is not a downgrade ─────────────────
 *
 * `lib/security/apiKeys.ts`, three files over, stores a SHA-256 hash and
 * throws the plaintext away. That is right for a credential somebody presents
 * TO us: we only ever need to recognise it.
 *
 * These are the opposite. We have to present them to the vendor on the user's
 * behalf, so they must be RECOVERABLE and a hash is useless. They are sealed
 * with AES-256-GCM by `lib/platform/secretBox.ts` — the same envelope the
 * platform console already uses for admin-set provider keys, reused
 * deliberately rather than reimplemented, because two encryption paths is one
 * more than anybody will keep correct.
 *
 * What that buys: a database dump, or an over-broad Supabase dashboard login,
 * yields ciphertext. What it does not buy: protection from anything that can
 * run code in this process, which by construction can open the envelope. Say
 * that plainly to users rather than implying a credential here is as safe as a
 * credential nowhere.
 *
 * ── SECRET vs PUBLIC, which is the non-obvious part ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Only IBM has a one-field credential. AWS and Azure credentials are several
 * fields, and only SOME of them are secret:
 *
 *   · An AWS **access key id** is an identifier, like a username. The **secret
 *     access key** is what authorises.
 *   · An Azure **tenant id** and **client id** name an app registration that
 *     the **client secret** authenticates.
 *
 * So each field is declared `secret: true` or not. The secret ones are sealed
 * into one envelope; the rest are stored in the clear and shown back to their
 * owner in full — because "which of my AWS accounts is attached?" is exactly
 * the question a credential listing exists to answer, and sealing the
 * identifiers would make it unanswerable.
 *
 * ── The rules this module enforces, not merely documents ────────────────────
 *
 * 1. A secret NEVER leaves this module in plaintext except through
 *    `resolveProviderCredential`, which exists for exactly one caller shape:
 *    a server route about to make one outbound vendor call. Nothing that
 *    serves a browser may call it. `listProviderCredentials` — the function
 *    the account panel is built from — cannot return a secret; its return type
 *    has no field for one.
 * 2. Nothing sealed goes in unsealed. `saveProviderCredential` seals, and the
 *    column has a `v1.` shape check behind it, so a future edit that forgets
 *    to seal fails loudly instead of quietly writing a credential in the clear.
 * 3. A secret is never logged, never put in an error message, and never
 *    included in a thrown Error's text. Every failure here reports the
 *    OPERATION that failed, never the value it was operating on.
