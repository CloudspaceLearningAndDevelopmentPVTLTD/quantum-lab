 * #                                                                          #
 * #  This limiter is PER INSTANCE. The counters live in the memory of one    #
 * #  Node process and nowhere else. That means:                              #
 * #                                                                          #
 * #    • Behind N instances the effective limit is N x `limit`.              #
 * #    • On a serverless platform (this app's default deployment target is   #
 * #      Vercel) every cold start begins with an empty map, and concurrent   #
 * #      invocations do not share one, so the effective limit approaches     #
 * #      "no limit at all" under exactly the load you would want to limit.   #
 * #    • A deploy resets every counter.                                      #
 * #                                                                          #
 * #  It therefore stops CASUAL ABUSE — a loop in a terminal, a runaway       #
 * #  client, a scraper that does not adapt — and NOTHING MORE. It is not a   #
 * #  control you can point at in a threat model.                             #
 * #                                                                          #
 * #  The real thing needs a SHARED STORE: Upstash/Redis keyed the same way,  #
 * #  or the platform's own edge rate limiting in front of the function.      #
 * #  See docs/SECURITY.md, "Known-weak areas".                               #

 * Fixed window, not sliding: a caller can burst `2 x limit` across a window
 * boundary. That is a known and accepted property — the alternative costs more
 * memory per key for an accuracy this tier does not need.
 *
 * No dependencies, no environment access, no timers: safe in the edge runtime
 * and in a completely empty environment.
