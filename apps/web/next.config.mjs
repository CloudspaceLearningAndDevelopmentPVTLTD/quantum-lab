/**
 * One identifier for this build, used in two places that MUST agree:
 *
 *  1. `generateBuildId`, i.e. Next's own build id (the `.next/BUILD_ID` file and
 *     the `/_next/static/<buildId>/` path segment).
 *  2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_STAMP`, which components/pwa/ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx
 *     appends to the service worker's script URL as `/sw.js?v=<stamp>`.
 *
 * Why they must agree: public/sw.js derives its cache name from that query
 * parameter. Before this existed, sw.js hard-coded `CACHE_VERSION = 'v1'` with a
 * comment telling a human to bump it on every deploy that changes cached assets.
 * Nothing enforced that, and the failure mode is invisible: sw.js is a static file
 * in public/, so a deploy that changes app code but not sw.js ships a
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL worker. The browser compares bytes, finds no change, fires no
 * update, and the previous deploy's cache — including its cached HTML — survives.
 * Deriving the stamp from the build id means a new build is a new script URL is a
 * new registration is a new cache. See docs/PWA.md § "Deploy invalidation".
 *
 * Preference order is deliberate: a commit SHA is stable across a rebuild of the
 * same commit, so redeploying identical code does not needlessly evict every
 * user's cache. Date.now() is the last resort for a local `next build`.
 *
 * DO NOT remove `generateBuildId` without also removing the sw.js coupling — a
 * stamp that no longer tracks the build id is worse than the hard-coded 'v1',
 * because it looks automatic.
