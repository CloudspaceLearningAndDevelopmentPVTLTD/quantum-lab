/*
 * Quantum Lab service worker — hand-written, no build step.
 *
 * This file is served verbatim from /sw.js, so it must be plain ES2020-era browser
 * JavaScript: no TypeScript, no imports from the app bundle, no npm dependencies.
 *
 * Why a service worker is worth it here: the visualizations, the circuit simulator and
 * the entire course are pure client-side TypeScript (apps/web/lib/quantum.ts) with no
 * backend. Once the HTML and the JS chunks are cached, all of that genuinely runs with
 * the network switched off. The only network-bound features are the AI tutor, billing
 * and saved-circuit sync — see the fetch handler for how those are deliberately
 * excluded from caching.

/**
 * Cache identity. Read from the script URL, NOT hard-coded.
 *
 * This file used to declare `const CACHE_VERSION = 'v1'` above a comment telling a
 * human to bump it on every deploy. That did not work, and could not:
 *
 *   sw.js is served verbatim from public/. A deploy that changes application code
 *   but not this file ships a byte-identical worker. The browser's update check
 *   compares the fetched script's bytes with the installed one's, finds them equal,
 *   and installs nothing. No install means no new cache, no `activate`, and no
 *   eviction — the previous deploy's cached HTML stays authoritative for as long as
 *   the user keeps the site installed. Since `handleNavigation` falls back to that
 *   cached HTML whenever the network takes longer than NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT_MS, a
 *   user on a slow connection could be served last month's HTML, pointing at
 *   /_next/static chunk hashes that the current deploy no longer serves.
 *
 * So the identity comes from the registration URL instead:
 * ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx registers `/sw.js?v=<NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_STAMP>`, and
 * next.config.mjs sets that stamp to the same value as Next's build id. A new build
 * is a new script URL, which the browser treats as a different script and installs.
 *
 * SCHEMA_VERSION is separate and manual: bump it when the SHAPE of what is cached
 * changes (a new APP_SHELL entry, a different strategy) in a way that must invalidate
 * even on a rebuild of the same commit. It is not a deploy counter.
 *
 * The 'unversioned' fallback covers a worker registered without the query parameter
 * — an old registration from before this change, or a hand-typed URL. It is a real
 * cache name so behaviour degrades to the old (never-rotating) semantics rather
 * than breaking; the next registration from the app supplies a stamp and rotates it.

  // It used to be called on every install. Two things were wrong with that once the
  // cache name became per-build:
  //
  //  1. `activate` deletes every cache that is not CACHE_NAME. With skipWaiting, the
  //     new worker activates while tabs are still running the PREVIOUS build's HTML.
  //     Those tabs' lazily-loaded chunks (three.js on the two WebGL routes, via
  //     next/dynamic) had just been deleted out from under them, and a self-hosted
  //     `next start` does not serve the previous build's hashed chunks. The
  //     visualization would fail to load in a tab the user never navigated.
  //  2. It made components/pwa/OfflineBanner.tsx's "A new version is ready → Reload"
  //     banner pointless: the worker never entered `waiting`, so
  //     `registration.waiting?.postMessage({type:'SKIP_WAITING'})` had nothing to
  //     post to and the button was a plain reload with extra steps.
  //
  // Now the new worker waits, the banner appears, and the user's click sends
  // SKIP_WAITING (see the `message` handler) immediately before the page reloads —
  // so the old cache is evicted at the one moment nothing is relying on it.
  //
  // On a FIRST install there is no controller, so the browser activates immediately
  // regardless and `clients.claim()` below still gives offline support without a
  // second reload. Waiting only ever delays an UPDATE.
