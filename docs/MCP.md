# MCP Server

Quantum Lab exposes its teaching-grade quantum tools over the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so any MCP-capable
agent platform — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, ChatGPT, or a custom
LangChain/Vegaduta agent — can run circuits, inspect statevectors mid-circuit,
generate and grade challenges, build study plans, export runnable notebooks,
read the free course, and (with a bearer token) submit to real hardware, using
exactly the same engines and gates the web app uses. The workbench adds two
result-producing families on top: `generate_verified_circuit` (a
generate → verify → repair loop against a spec you write) and the experiment
record tools (`create_experiment` … `get_experiment`), which an agent uses to
run and write up an experiment that `/workbench/experiments` then displays.

Seventeen tools in total: eleven core, one for verified generation, five for
experiment records.

**Endpoint:** `POST https://<your-deployment>/api/mcp/mcp`
(locally: `http://localhost:3000/api/mcp/mcp`)

**Transport:** Streamable HTTP, stateless JSON mode. Every JSON-RPC request is
answered with a single `application/json` response; the server opens no SSE
stream (`GET` returns 405, which the spec defines as "no server-initiated
stream offered") and issues no session id. Supported handshake protocol
revisions: `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`, `2024-11-05`.

**Code:**

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web/lib/mcp/server.ts` | Tool registry — thin wrappers over `lib/quantum.ts`, `lib/challenges`, `lib/lessons` |
| `apps/web/app/api/mcp/[transport]/route.ts` | JSON-RPC / Streamable HTTP endpoint, rate limiting, origin guard |
| `apps/web/lib/mcp/tools.test.ts` | Tests for every tool and for the protocol layer |
| `apps/web/lib/workbench/mcpTool.ts`, `lib/workbench/generate.ts`, `lib/workbench/verify.ts` | `generate_verified_circuit`: input schema and parsing, the generate → verify → repair loop, the exact verifier |
| `apps/web/lib/workbench/experimentTools.ts` | The experiment-record tools (targets, steps, conclusions); tests in `lib/workbench/*.test.ts` |

No SDK dependency: the stateless subset of the transport is ~150 lines, and the
repo's rule is that route handlers keep building in an empty environment (see
`lib/rateLimit.ts`). The registry is shaped as `(name, inputSchema, handler)`
so it can be re-registered on `@modelcontextprotocol/server`'s `McpServer` via
Vercel's `mcp-handler` the day this server needs OAuth, sampling, or resumable
streams — the route's header comment records that upgrade path.

## Tools

All tool results carry the payload twice: as `structuredContent` (for clients
on protocol `2025-06-18`+) and as the same JSON pretty-printed into a `text`
content block (for older clients). Bitstring labels are MSB-first — qubit 0 is
the rightmost character — matching Qiskit's display convention.

### `run_circuit`

Simulate OpenQASM 3 on an ideal statevector simulator and sample measurement
outcomes. The differentiator: it returns the **final statevector amplitudes**
alongside the counts, so an agent can reason about phases — most MCP quantum
sims stop at counts.

Input:

```json
{
  "qasm": "OPENQASM 3.0;\ninclude \"stdgates.inc\";\nqubit[2] q;\nh q[0];\ncx q[0], q[1];",
  "shots": 4096,
  "seed": 42
}
```

`shots` is clamped to 1–4096 (default 1024); `seed` is optional and makes the
sampling reproducible. Registers are capped at 16 qubits. Supported gates:
`h x y z s sdg t tdg sx sxdg rx ry rz p cx cy cz swap ccx cswap` (controls
listed first), plus `ctrl(n) @ x …` for a multi-controlled X, `barrier`, a
custom unitary declared as a `gate` definition, and the register blocks the
app exports (`qb16_add_<k>_mod_<N>_w<width>`, `qb16_mul_<k>_mod_<N>_w<width>`,
`qb16_qft_w<width>`, `qb16_iqft_w<width>`). `get_gate_reference` lists the
QASM spelling of every one of them.

Output (`structuredContent`):

```json
{
  "numQubits": 2,
  "gateCount": 2,
  "shots": 4096,
  "counts": { "00": 2049, "11": 2047 },
  "statevector": [
    { "state": "00", "re": 0.7071067811865476, "im": 0, "probability": 0.5 },
    { "state": "11", "re": 0.7071067811865476, "im": 0, "probability": 0.5 }
  ],
  "omittedNearZeroAmplitudes": 2,
  "conventions": "Bitstring labels are MSB-first (qubit 0 is the rightmost character), matching Qiskit."
}
```

Amplitudes with magnitude below 1e-10 are omitted and counted in
`omittedNearZeroAmplitudes`, so a 16-qubit reply stays kilobytes, not
megabytes, and "sparse" is distinguishable from "missing".

### `get_statevector_at_step`

The step-through inspector's engine: the state **after step N**, where step 0
is the initial |0…0⟩ and step k is the state after the k-th gate. Also returns
each qubit's Bloch vector and entanglement entropy at that step — watch
entanglement appear gate by gate.

Input: `{ "qasm": "…", "step": 1 }` · Output adds `step`, `totalSteps`,
`appliedGate` (`null` at step 0), `statevector` (same sparse shape as above),
and `blochVectors: [{ qubit, x, y, z, entanglementEntropy }]`. An out-of-range
step is an error naming the valid range.

### `list_challenges`

The full challenge catalogue: `id`, `title`, `brief`, `kind`
(`target-state` / `target-distribution` / `gate-golf` / `fix-the-bug` /
`oracle`), `level`, `numQubits`, `lessonSlug`, `maxGates`, `hintCount`, and —
where the challenge hands the learner fixed apparatus — `startingCircuitQasm`.
Hints themselves are withheld here so a solver earns them.

### `grade_challenge`

Grade an OpenQASM 3 attempt against a challenge id with the **same
deterministic grader the UI uses** — phase-aware for oracle challenges, blind
to global phase everywhere (see `lib/challenges/grade.ts`). Accepts both
catalogue ids from `list_challenges` and **generated ids** from
`generate_challenge` (`gen-<kind>-d<difficulty>-s<seed>`): a generated id
encodes everything needed to deterministically rebuild the challenge, so the
regrade sees bit-for-bit the puzzle the generator returned. This is why no
server-side state exists for generated challenges — the id *is* the challenge
params.

Input: `{ "challenge_id": "flip-it", "qasm": "OPENQASM 3.0;\nqubit[1] q;\nx q[0];" }`

Output:

```json
{
  "challengeId": "flip-it",
  "passed": true,
  "score": 1,
  "summary": "Solved in 1 gate.",
  "checks": [
    { "label": "Register size", "passed": true, "detail": "1 qubit, as the challenge asks." },
    { "label": "Output distribution", "passed": true, "detail": "Every basis state is on target. …" }
  ],
  "gateCount": 1,
  "parCount": 1,
  "successNote": "X is the quantum NOT: …",
  "hint": null
}
```

A failed attempt gets `passed: false`, the per-check feedback, and the
challenge's **first** hint; further hints stay in the app.

### `generate_challenge`

Generate a fresh practice challenge — "more like this, please" — from
`lib/challenges/generate.ts`. Deterministic: the same
`(kind, difficulty, seed)` always yields the same challenge, and **every
challenge is verified solvable by execution before it is returned**: the
generator runs its own reference solution through the real simulator and
grader and asserts a full pass, that the empty circuit fails (no degenerate
targets), and that every solution gate matters (par is tight). For
`fix-the-bug`, the broken starting circuit is also confirmed to fail.

Input:

```json
{ "kind": "target-distribution", "difficulty": 2, "seed": 7 }
```

`kind` is `target-state` | `target-distribution` | `fix-the-bug`; `difficulty`
1–3 maps to 1–3 qubits and 2–3 gates; `seed` (default 0) is the reproducibility
handle.

Output: `id` (e.g. `gen-target-distribution-d2-s7`), `title`, `brief`, `kind`,
`level`, `difficulty`, `seed`, `numQubits`, `lessonSlug`, `maxGates` (the
verified par), `tolerance`, `targetProbabilities` (basis states 0…2ⁿ−1,
MSB-first labels), `startingCircuitQasm` (fix-the-bug only), and `hintCount`.
Hints and the reference solution are **withheld** — they would hand over the
answer with the puzzle. Grade attempts with `grade_challenge` using the
returned `id`; a failed grade earns the first hint.

### `get_session_plan`

Turn a learner progress snapshot into a structured study plan, using the same
recommender as the `/coach` page (`lib/coach/sessionPlan.ts`). **Stateless by
design**: the caller supplies the snapshot, the plan is computed from the
arguments alone, nothing is stored, and the same snapshot always yields the
same plan.

Input:

```json
{
  "progress": {
    "completed": ["what-is-a-qubit"],
    "quizScores": { "what-is-a-qubit": 0.5 }
  },
  "exam_attempts": [{ "examId": "foundations", "score": 0.8 }],
  "goal": "grover"
}
```

Only `progress` is required (pass `{}` for a brand-new learner and get the
start-here plan). Junk fields are dropped, not rejected.

Output: `weakSkills` (started concepts below the 70% mastery bar, with rounded
mastery), `nextConcepts` (unlocked lesson slugs in recommendation order), and
`suggestedSession` — up to four steps, `diagnose → teach → practice → check`,
each with a concrete ref (`lessonSlug`, `challengeId`, or `vizRoute`) and a
one-sentence note.

### `export_notebook`

Build a runnable Jupyter notebook from an OpenQASM 3 circuit — the same
export the app's editor offers (`lib/export/notebook.ts`).

Input: `{ "qasm": "…", "variant": "qiskit" | "pennylane", "name": "Bell pair" }`

Output: `{ variant, filename, numQubits, gateCount, notebook }` where
`notebook` is the complete `.ipynb` JSON (nbformat 4.5, Colab-compatible cell
ids) as a string — save it to the suggested `filename`. The `qiskit` variant
loads the QASM via `qiskit.qasm3` and runs on Aer or the reference Sampler;
the `pennylane` variant rebuilds the circuit gate by gate, since PennyLane has
no QASM 3 importer. Exports are deterministic: the same circuit produces a
byte-identical notebook.

### `submit_hardware_job`

Submit a circuit to a real quantum device (IBM or AWS Braket). **This spends
real money and is the one authenticated tool** — see
[Hardware authentication](#hardware-authentication).

Input:

```json
{ "qasm": "…", "backend": "ibm_brisbane", "shots": 1024, "provider": "ibm" }
```

(`provider` is optional; it is derived from the backend id.) A successful
submission returns `{ submitted: true, status, job: { job_id, provider, … } }`;
poll the job from the app's `/hardware` page. Refusals come back as tool
errors carrying the gate's own message — 401 (no/invalid token), 402 (plan
without `hardware.real`, or the monthly job allowance is spent), 429 (rate
limited), 503 (quota store unavailable — fail closed).

### `list_lessons`

Metadata for all 14 course lessons plus the two tracks: `slug`, `title`,
`subtitle`, `level`, `minutes`, `prerequisites`, `objectives`, `track`, and
`free` (true for the eight foundations lessons, false for the six advanced
ones).

### `get_lesson`

One lesson by slug. A **free** lesson includes its full `body` — prose blocks,
code, quizzes, key points. A **paid** (advanced-track) lesson returns metadata
only: `body: null`, `bodyWithheld: true`, and a note pointing at the app. The
body module is never even queried for a paid slug — the paywall is control
flow, not filtering.

### `get_gate_reference`

The full gate library the circuit-builder palette shows: `name`, `label`,
`qasmName`, `arity`, `variadic` (true for the multi-controlled X and the
register blocks, whose width is chosen when they are placed), `takesAngle`, and
a teaching description per gate, plus a usage note for angles, controls,
`ctrl(n) @ x`, and the `qb16_*` register-block definitions.

### `generate_verified_circuit`

The workbench's verified generation (`/workbench/generate`) as a tool. Give it
a **spec** — a target measurement distribution, a target statevector, or a
target unitary, with optional gate-set / depth / gate-count constraints — and
it runs a generate → verify → repair loop: a model proposes an OpenQASM 3
circuit, the exact statevector simulator checks it against the spec, and on
failure the diagnostics (which basis states are off and by how much, the
fidelity, which gates violate a constraint) are fed back for another round.
Every attempt comes back with its circuit, verdict and diff.

Input:

```json
{
  "spec": {
    "numQubits": 2,
    "target": { "kind": "distribution", "probabilities": { "00": 0.5, "11": 0.5 }, "tolerance": 0.02 },
    "constraints": { "allowedGates": ["H", "CX"], "maxDepth": 4 }
  },
  "max_attempts": 3,
  "candidate_qasm": "OPENQASM 3.0;\ninclude \"stdgates.inc\";\nqubit[2] q;\nh q[0];\ncx q[0], q[1];"
}
```

`spec.target` is one of:

| `kind` | Fields | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `distribution` | `probabilities` (MSB-first labels → p; unlisted labels are 0; must sum to 1), `tolerance?` | every label is within tolerance |
| `statevector` | `amplitudes` (2ⁿ numbers or `{re, im}`), `minFidelity?` | \|⟨t\|ψ⟩\|² ≥ minFidelity, up to global phase |
| `unitary` | `matrix` (row-major 2ⁿ×2ⁿ), `minFidelity?` | \|Tr(V†U)\|²/d² ≥ minFidelity, up to global phase |

`constraints` is `{ maxQubits?, allowedGates?, maxDepth?, maxGates? }`.
`max_attempts` is 1–6 (default 3); a supplied `candidate_qasm` counts as a
round and is verified **first** — if it passes, no model is called at all, so
`candidate_qasm` with `max_attempts: 1` makes the tool a pure verifier that
needs no model.

Output (`structuredContent`): `ok`, `stopped` (why the loop ended), `error`,
`provider` and `modelCalls` (which model was used, how many times), `circuit`
and `qasm` (the passing circuit, or null), `attempts[]` (each with its QASM,
verdict and diagnostics), the `spec` echoed back, and a `caveat`. A
`providerNote` is added when no model is configured for the caller's tier —
then only the candidate, if any, was verified.

What a pass means: the circuit matches **your** spec on an ideal simulator.
It says nothing about whether the spec is what you meant, and nothing about
hardware.

### Experiment records — `create_experiment`, `run_step`, `conclude_experiment`, `list_experiments`, `get_experiment`

The workbench's lab notebook (`apps/web/lib/workbench/experimentTools.ts`,
read at `/workbench/experiments`). An agent opens a record with a hypothesis,
appends one step per circuit it runs — the exact QASM, the **target** it ran
on, the result and a note — and closes it with a conclusion. Steps are
append-only; a concluded record refuses new ones.

Targets (`apps/web/lib/workbench/targets.ts`):

| `target` | What runs | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"simulator"` or `{ "kind": "simulator" }` | `run()` from `lib/quantum.ts`, ≤ 16 qubits | counts + sparse amplitudes |
| `{ "kind": "noisy-simulator", "depolarizing1": 0.001, "depolarizing2": 0.01, "readoutError": 0.02 }` | a Pauli-error model on the same engine: depolarising after every 1-qubit gate (p₁) and 2-qubit gate (p₂), independent readout flips (r); ≤ 10 qubits; every parameter optional with those defaults | counts + `erroredShots` |
| `{ "kind": "hardware", "backend": "ibm_brisbane", "provider": "ibm" }` | the **same pass-through as `submit_hardware_job`** — an internal request to `/api/hardware/submit` with the caller's bearer token, every gate intact | the job handle; a refusal records nothing |

The noise model is tested against its closed forms (`targets.test.ts`):
|0⟩→X under p₁ reads 0 with probability p₁/2; a Bell pair under p₂ shows odd
parity with probability p₂/2; readout error r on |0⟩ reads 1 with probability r.
It is a model, not a device — no T1/T2, crosstalk, leakage or correlated readout.

```json
{ "title": "Bell pair under two-qubit noise",
  "hypothesis": "Odd-parity counts appear at about p2/2 when CX is depolarised with probability p2." }
```
→ `{ id, title, hypothesis, steps: [], conclusion: null, createdAt, owner, url }`

```json
{ "experiment_id": "<id>", "qasm": "…", "target": { "kind": "noisy-simulator", "depolarizing2": 0.05 },
  "shots": 4096, "seed": 1, "note": "Prediction: ~2.5% odd parity." }
```
→ `{ experimentId, stepIndex, stepCount, target, targetLabel, result, note, url }`

`conclude_experiment` takes `{ experiment_id, conclusion }` and returns the
full record; `list_experiments` (`{ limit? }`) returns summaries newest first
plus `storage` (`memory` or `supabase`); `get_experiment` returns one record
with every step. Shots clamp to 1–4096 (default 1024); `seed` makes simulator
counts reproducible.

**Storage and visibility.** With `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set, records live
in `public.experiments` / `public.experiment_steps`
(`supabase/schema-experiments.sql`, service-role only, RLS on with no policy).
Without it they live in the server process's memory — at most 200 records of
200 steps, gone on restart, not shared between serverless instances — and the
page says which. Writing a record spends no money, so these tools need no
token; `owner` is set to the verified caller when a bearer token was present
and is attribution only. **Every record on a deployment is readable by anyone
who can open the page**, and the tool descriptions tell agents so.

---

## Rate limits

Enforced by `lib/rateLimit.ts` — the same shared-store limiter as `/api/agent`
(Redis-backed when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`KV_REST_API_URL` are configured,
per-instance in-memory otherwise; read that module's header before quoting
these as a hard control):

| Window | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Per minute, per caller | 60 requests |
| Per hour, per caller | 1 000 requests |
| Request body | 128 KB |
| QASM per call | 20 000 characters |
| Qubits | 16 |
| Shots | 4 096 (clamped, not rejected) |

429 responses carry `retry-after` and `x-ratelimit-reset` headers.

---

## Hardware authentication

`submit_hardware_job` is the only tool that needs an identity, because it is
the only tool that spends money. The auth story:

- **Send a Supabase access token as a Bearer header on the MCP request.** The
  same token the web app holds after sign-in (`supabase.auth.getSession()`
  → `session.access_token`). For Claude Code:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http quantum-lab \
    https://<your-deployment>/api/mcp/mcp \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <supabase access token>"
  ```

  or in `.mcp.json`, add
  `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }` to the server entry.
- **Without a token the tool refuses immediately**, naming exactly what is
  needed, and touches nothing — the billing stack is not even loaded
  (`lib/mcp/tools.test.ts` pins this).
- **With a token, the tool dispatches an internal request to the real
  `/api/hardware/submit` route handler**, `Authorization` header attached.
  Every gate that route enforces runs unchanged, because it is literally the
  same code: IP and per-account rate limits, `requireCaller` (Supabase-verified
  identity — the token is validated by `supabase.auth.getUser`, never parsed
  locally), body shape validation, `requireFeature('hardware.real')` (402 for
  Free), and the atomic monthly-quota reservation (fail-closed 503 when the
  meter cannot answer). The MCP layer re-implements **none** of these and adds
  no bypass: if the gate chain changes, the tool inherits the change.
- **The token is never stored.** The MCP endpoint remains stateless; the header
  is read per-request, handed to the tool context, forwarded once, and dropped.
- Tokens expire (Supabase defaults to 1 hour). Refresh and re-add the header
  when submissions start answering 401. Full OAuth (dynamic client
  registration per the MCP authorization spec) remains the documented upgrade
  path, at which point adopt `@modelcontextprotocol/server` via `mcp-handler`.

---

## Security posture

**Unauthenticated by design, and safe to be — for every tool except
`submit_hardware_job`:** the rest are read/compute-only over content that is
already public or free.

- Simulation (`run_circuit`, `get_statevector_at_step`) is deterministic,
  local CPU work — no money is spent, no state is written, and the cost per
  request is bounded by the 16-qubit / 4 096-shot clamps plus the rate limits.
- The challenge catalogue, generator, and grader are the same code that runs,
  ungated, in every visitor's browser tab. Generated challenges are pure
  functions of `(kind, difficulty, seed)` — no server state, nothing to leak.
- `get_session_plan` computes over the snapshot the caller supplies and stores
  nothing; `export_notebook` is a pure string builder over the caller's own
  circuit.
- Lesson **metadata** is public (it is in every page's search index). Lesson
  **bodies** are served only for slugs `isLessonFree` approves — the paid
  advanced track is metadata-only over MCP, the same boundary the web app's
  server-side paywall enforces (`lib/lessons/access.ts`). MCP callers get
  strictly *less* than an anonymous browser, which also receives a three-block
  preview of paid lessons.

**Deliberately not exposed:** billing, organizations, user accounts, progress,
certificates, email — no read/compute tool in `lib/mcp/` imports any of those
modules. **Real-hardware submission** is exposed only through
`submit_hardware_job`, which is a token-gated pass-through to the real
`/api/hardware/submit` route with its entire gate chain intact (see
[Hardware authentication](#hardware-authentication)); the billing stack is
loaded only after a Bearer token is present, and identity comes exclusively
from the transport's `Authorization` header — never from a tool argument an
agent could fabricate.

Additional transport-level guards, per the Streamable HTTP spec: `Origin`
headers, when a browser sends one, must match the deployment host (DNS
rebinding defence — headless MCP clients send no Origin and are unaffected);
bodies are size-capped before parsing; an unsupported `MCP-Protocol-Version`
header gets a 400.
