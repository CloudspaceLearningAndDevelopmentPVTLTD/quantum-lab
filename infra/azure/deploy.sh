# Quantum Lab — one-shot Azure Container Apps deploy.
#
# Run this from ANY shell with the Azure CLI installed and `az login` already
# done — your own machine (Git Bash/PowerShell/WSL), Azure Cloud Shell, or
# this repo's CI. Unlike the AWS script, this one does NOT need Docker
# installed locally: `az acr build` builds every image in Azure itself.
#
# VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION (October 2026): the resources this script creates
# (quantum-lab-rg, the registry, the Container Apps environment and the three
# apps) serve qubit16.ai, and its `az acr build` / `az containerapp update`
# steps are the ones .github/workflows/deploy.yml runs on every green main.
# If a step's flags drift from your `az` CLI version it fails with a normal az
# error — re-run the script, it is idempotent (every resource is
# check-then-create).
#
# What it does, in order (mirrors docs/DEPLOYMENT-AZURE.md):
#   1. Creates a resource group + a Basic-tier Azure Container Registry
#   2. Builds all 3 images IN THE CLOUD via `az acr build` (no local Docker)
#   3. Creates a Container Apps environment (Consumption plan)
#   4. Deploys api as an always-on Container App (min-replicas 1 — see the
#      comment above its deploy step), smallest valid size (0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GiB)
#   5. Deploys agent as scale-to-zero (0..1 replicas), same size
#   6. Rebuilds web with real API/agent URLs baked in, deploys web also
#      always-on (min-replicas 1 — see the comment above its deploy step,
#      also 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GiB)
#   7. Points api + agent's ALLOWED_ORIGINS at the real web URL
#   8. Tries to set a monthly cost budget alert (best-effort — some
#      subscription types reject this over the CLI; falls back to a portal
#      pointer if so)
#   9. Prints the 3 live URLs + curl checks
#
# Cost model is fundamentally different from the AWS App Runner version:
# Container Apps CAN scale to zero, so a service left at min-replicas=0 with
# no traffic bills $0 in compute. api and web are both pinned to
# min-replicas=1 instead (see the comments above each deploy step for why —
# both trade ~$10-15/mo each for no cold-start tax), so only agent actually
# scales to zero here. The fixed floor is therefore roughly $20-30/mo
# (api + web always-on) plus the Basic ACR (~$5/mo flat) and a small amount of
# Log Analytics ingestion (~$0-2/mo at this volume) — see
# docs/DEPLOYMENT-AZURE.md for the full breakdown.

# `az acr build` call here, which then failed as "docker build requires
# exactly 1 argument" with no clue the real cause was an env var three steps
# removed from the error. MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 disables the rewrite; it is a
# no-op everywhere this script also runs (native Linux/macOS shells, Azure

# `update` branches below (unlike `create`) never passed registry
# credentials at all and so had nothing to refresh even if they had.
# Fixed two ways: (1) if ACR_NAME is not explicitly set, look for an ACR
# already in this resource group and reuse it before falling back to a new
# random name; (2) every `az containerapp update --image` call below now
# also runs `az containerapp registry set`, so credentials are refreshed on

# ---- Deploy the COMMIT, never the working directory -----------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Everything below hands the current directory to
# `az acr build`, which tars it and ships it to Azure. That means a deploy
# used to publish whatever happened to be on disk at that instant — including
# somebody else's half-finished edit, a file saved mid-keystroke, or a
# package.json whose new dependency was not in the lockfile yet.
#
# All three happened on 2026-09-17. A web build failed with
#
#     lib/env.ts(163,5): error TS2322: Type '"client"' is not assignable to type 'Scope'
#
# for a value that was already corrected by the time anybody read the log: the
# tar had caught the file between two keystrokes. Nothing was wrong with the
# committed tree, and nothing in the error said so.
#
# A fourth, worse one: bash reads a script LAZILY, by byte offset. Editing
# deploy.sh while deploy.sh is running makes it resume at the wrong offset and
# execute garbage. Re-running from a pristine checkout fixes that too, because
# the script that runs is the committed one.
#
# So: check out HEAD into a throwaway worktree and re-exec there. What gets
# deployed is exactly what `git show HEAD` says, every time.
#
# `git worktree` rather than `git clone`: no network, no second object store,
# and it can pin an exact commit. On this repo it takes about a second.
#
# UNCOMMITTED WORK IS NOT DEPLOYED, and that is the entire point — but it is
# announced loudly rather than silently dropped, because "I deployed and my
# change is not there" is a horrible ten minutes.

# `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters...` the
# moment Docker's build output contains a character cp1252 can't represent
# (observed in practice on this repo's Python builder stage). The build
# itself is unaffected — it runs on Azure regardless of whether the local

# watching it live was. Polling sidesteps the crash entirely, on every

# ---- The api/web shared secret -------------------------------------------
#
# THIS USED TO BE `API_SHARED_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"`, unconditionally,
# on every run. Two services hold this value — the api (as API_SHARED_SECRET)
# and the web container (as QUANTUM_API_SECRET) — and they are deployed one
# after the other, api first. So every single deploy rotated the secret and then
# spent the several minutes between the two updates with the web container
# presenting a value the api no longer accepted. Every proxied hardware call
# returned "This API requires a shared secret" for that whole window, on a
# deploy that may have changed nothing but a paragraph of copy. Observed in
# production on 2026-09-17.
#
# Two things were wrong and both are fixed:
#
#   1. ROTATION WAS A SIDE EFFECT OF SHIPPING. It is now opt-in. An ordinary
#      deploy does not touch the secret at all — neither container's copy is
#      rewritten, so they cannot drift apart and there is no window. Rotating a
#      credential is a deliberate operation with a cost; paying that cost to
#      deploy a CSS change bought nothing.
#
#   2. ROTATION ITSELF HAD NO SAFE ORDERING. With one accepted value, whichever
#      service you update first is wrong until the other catches up — updating
#      web first just inverts which side 401s. services/api now accepts a
#      COMMA-SEPARATED LIST (app/core/security.py), so a rotation can run as an
#      overlap: teach the api both values, move web to the new one, then retire
#      the old. No step in that sequence refuses a correctly-configured caller.
#
# To actually rotate:
#
#     ROTATE_API_SECRET=1 bash infra/azure/deploy.sh
#
ROTATE_API_SECRET="${ROTATE_API_SECRET:-0}"

# Non-empty ONLY when this run must write a secret value. Empty on an ordinary

# --------------------------------------------------------------- 4. api
# min-replicas=1 (not 0) is a deliberate exception to this file's
# scale-to-zero-everywhere default. The api container imports Qiskit/Aer at
# startup and /api/health runs a real probe circuit through it — a cold
# request pays for both the container boot AND that import, which measured
# ~5s in production. That was surfaced as "it takes too long to load, even
# after being idle for a bit" and traded away deliberately: one always-on
# 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GiB replica costs roughly $10-15/mo, in exchange for the
# api never cold-starting. agent stays scale-to-zero (min-replicas 0) below
# since it has no import-cost problem of its own and is hit far less often.
#
# web used to be scale-to-zero here too, on the reasoning that Next.js has no
# Qiskit-style import cost. That reasoning held when the site was ~30 routes;
# it stopped holding once three content waves grew it past 100 routes on the
# same 0.25 vCPU container. Measured directly against production (browser
# Navigation/Resource Timing, not guessed): a page not hit in the last
# ~5 minutes (Next's own route-cache staleness window, see x-nextjs-stale-time)
# pays a real reload tax on its next click — up to ~2.2s observed on a
# content-heavy route, driven by large per-route JS chunks and/or a cold
# container, vs. 300-550ms for a route hit recently. Surfaced as "the app is
# so slow ... on click of different modules". Same fix as api's, and the same

# 3 commands have had zero real-world exercise. Read before running.
#
# WHAT AND WHY: Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub's $25,000 credit
# milestone requires 5+ *distinct* Azure services with >=$1 spend each,
# sustained ~60 days — see docs/AZURE-CREDITS.md. This deployment alone
# only touches 2 (Container Registry, Container Apps). This section adds
# 3 more, on purpose, purely to diversify billed services toward that
# milestone. It is a deliberate reversal of this script's own "minimal
# hardware" instinct — roughly +$30-40/mo — which is exactly why it is
# opt-in rather than automatic.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: provisioning these resources does not connect
# them to the running application. apps/web/lib/supabase.ts speaks
# Supabase's SDK/REST API, not raw Postgres wire protocol, so Azure
# Database for PostgreSQL here is a separate resource generating its own
# spend, not a drop-in Supabase replacement. Same for Redis (the app
# expects Upstash's REST API, not Azure Cache for Redis's native
# protocol) and Azure OpenAI (the LLM gateway in docs/LLM-GATEWAY.md has
# no Azure provider wired in yet). Actually using any of these in the app
# is separate follow-up work this script does not do.
