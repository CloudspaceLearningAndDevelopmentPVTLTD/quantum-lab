"""Fetch and interpret arXiv papers for the tutor.

This is the only part of the agent service that touches the network. It calls
the public arXiv Atom API at ``http://export.arxiv.org/api/query`` with
``httpx`` and parses the response with :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` from the
standard library — deliberately no feedparser, no extra dependency.

Failure is treated as ordinary: no key, no account and no retry storm. Every
public function returns a dict, and on a timeout, a DNS failure, a bad status
or an empty result set it returns ``{"error": ...}`` with an actionable message
instead of raising, so a flaky network can never take down an agent turn.
