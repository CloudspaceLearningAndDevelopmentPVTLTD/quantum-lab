"""Startup environment validation for the Qubit16 agent service.

Mirror of ``services/api/app/core/env_check.py``: two services, one rule. The
list was derived by grepping ``services/agent/agent`` for ``os.environ`` and
reading ``agent/config.py``.

WHY NOTHING IS REQUIRED. The service starts, answers ``/api/agent/health`` with
``configured: false`` and replies to chat with setup instructions when there is
no API key — that is a deliberate degradation, not an outage. So the errors here
are misconfigurations rather than absences:

* ``ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` containing ``*``, which on a service that spends the
  operator's Anthropic budget means any page a user visits can call it as them.
* Clamp values (``MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS``, ``MAX_AGENT_SECONDS``, ``MAX_SHOTS`` …) set
  to zero or below. These bound what an instruction hidden in a lesson, a paper
  abstract or a learner's QASM can spend; a non-positive value is either a
  deployment typo or an attempt to remove the bound, and both should stop the
  service rather than quietly disable a security control.

The one warning worth reading is the RAG index: retrieval degrades in complete
silence when the artifact is missing, and the tutor's answers just get worse.
