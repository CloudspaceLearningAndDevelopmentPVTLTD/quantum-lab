"""FastAPI surface for the QuantumMind tutor.

Exposes two endpoints under ``/api/agent``: a chat endpoint that proxies to
:func:`agent.core.ask`, and a health endpoint that reports whether the service
is configured. Importing this module never requires an API key; an unconfigured
service answers chat requests with setup instructions and ``configured: false``
rather than an error.

Run it with::

# http://localhost:3000, which meant a deployed operator had no way to set it
# correctly and every method and header was accepted from it. It now comes from
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS (the same variable services/api reads), a wildcard is refused
# in Settings.origins_list, and the method/header wildcards are replaced with
# the exact sets this service uses.
#
# `allow_credentials=True` is what makes all of that matter: with credentials
# allowed, whoever is in `allow_origins` may call this endpoint as the visitor
# and read the reply — on a service that spends the operator's Anthropic budget.
