"""Tools the QuantumMind tutor can call.

Every tool is implemented twice over:

* ``_<name>_impl`` — a plain Python function containing the real logic. These
  are importable and callable with **no API key and no network**, and they are
  what the test suite exercises directly.
* a LangChain ``@tool``-wrapped version, created at the bottom of the module
  only if ``langchain_core`` happens to be installed. When it is not, the
  wrappers are simply absent and :data:`ALL_TOOLS` is empty; nothing else
  changes.

The docstrings on the ``_impl`` functions are the tool descriptions the model
reads to decide when to call them, so they are written for that audience.

    This is the localization tool of the debugging loop. run_quantum_circuit

    it when a circuit's counts surprise the learner, then scan the per-step
    states for the first step whose state no longer matches what they intended
    — the gate applied at that step is where the bug lives. Cite the observed
    step states in your answer ("after step 3, qubit 2 is |1> because...").

    Measurements, barriers and resets are skipped, so the states are the ideal
