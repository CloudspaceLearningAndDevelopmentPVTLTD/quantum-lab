"""Submission and polling for Microsoft Azure Quantum targets.

This mirrors :mod:`app.quantum.hardware` exactly: Azure Quantum is a queued,
shared resource, so it is modelled as **submit then poll**. ``submit_azure_job``
enqueues and returns a job handle immediately; ``poll_azure_job`` looks that
handle up and attaches counts only once the job is done. The record shapes are
identical to the IBM and Braket functions so the existing routers, job store and
TypeScript client need no changes.

The ``azure-quantum`` SDK is imported lazily inside the functions that need it,
and configuration is read from ``AZURE_QUANTUM_RESOURCE_ID`` and
``AZURE_QUANTUM_LOCATION`` (already present in ``.env.example``). A missing SDK
or a missing variable raises :class:`~app.quantum.hardware.MissingDependency`,
which is a :class:`ValueError`, with the exact pip package or variable named.

    WHY BYOK ON AZURE NEEDS A SERVICE PRINCIPAL
    -------------------------------------------

    The operator path passes no credential, so the SDK falls back to

    environment, a managed identity, or a developer's signed-in CLI session.
    Every one of those is a property of the MACHINE, not of the request — there
    is no way to say "this user, this call" through any of them.

    So a user bringing their own Azure workspace registers an app in their own
    tenant and hands over a service principal: tenant id, client id, client
    secret. That is genuinely more work than IBM's two-minute token, and the
    account panel says so rather than presenting the two as equivalent.

    The ``ClientSecretCredential`` is constructed per call and passed
    EXPLICITLY. Nothing is written to the environment — see the invariant at
    the top of app/quantum/credentials.py for why that would be the worst
    available implementation.
