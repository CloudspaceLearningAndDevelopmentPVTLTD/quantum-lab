"""Per-request vendor credentials — BYOK, for every hardware provider.

Every hardware call in this service used to read its credentials from one
place: ``settings``, populated from the process environment at start-up. That
makes exactly one account's allowance spendable — the operator's — and it is
why a monthly job quota exists on the web side at all.

This module carries the other case. When a user has stored their own vendor
credential, ``apps/web`` opens it, attaches it to **one** outbound request as a
header, and the value arrives here. It is parsed into an immutable record,
handed to the call that needs it, and dropped.

THE INVARIANT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PROTECT
-------------------------------------------

A presented credential is **never written into** ``settings``, and never into
``os.environ``. Not as a convenience, not "just for this request", not behind a
lock.

Both are process-global and this service handles concurrent requests. A
credential written to either is visible to every other request in flight, which
means one user's submission could be enqueued against another user's account —
the worst failure this feature can have, silent, and discoverable only from a
stranger's billing console.

``os.environ`` deserves its own sentence because it is the tempting shortcut
for AWS: boto3 reads ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` from the environment, so "just set it
for the call" looks like it works and does, right up until two users submit at
once. Every provider below is therefore threaded as an EXPLICIT session or
client object, never through ambient configuration.

WHAT EACH PROVIDER NEEDS, AND WHICH PARTS ARE SECRET
----------------------------------------------------

=========  ================================  ==========================================
Provider   Secret (sealed, never displayed)   Public (shown back to its owner in full)
=========  ================================  ==========================================
ibm        token                              instance (CRN)
braket     secret_access_key, session_token   access_key_id, region, s3_bucket, s3_prefix
azure      client_secret                      resource_id, location, tenant_id, client_id
=========  ================================  ==========================================

The split is not cosmetic: the public half is stored in the clear and rendered
back so somebody can see *which* account is attached, and the secret half is
sealed and never leaves the server. An AWS access key id is an identifier, like
a username — it is the secret access key that authorises. Treating the id as
secret would mean nobody could tell which of their AWS accounts is wired up.

WHY A HEADER AND NOT A BODY FIELD
---------------------------------

Polling is a GET, so a body was never available there, and a query parameter is
the worst option: URLs end up in access logs, error reports and proxy traces. A
header keeps the credential out of all of them and lets submit and poll share
one mechanism rather than two.

The value is base64 for TRANSPORT SAFETY, not secrecy — it is trivially
reversible and nothing here pretends otherwise. It exists so a credential
containing a byte that is illegal in an HTTP header value cannot corrupt or
split the request.
