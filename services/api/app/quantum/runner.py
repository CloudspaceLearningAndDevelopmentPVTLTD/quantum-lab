#
# They are IBM's published median calibration figures for the Eagle r3 family
# (ibm_brisbane / ibm_kyiv / ibm_sherbrooke — the three devices this service
# lists in app/quantum/hardware.py KNOWN_DEVICES), rounded to the precision the
# medians are quoted at. They are a SPECIFICATION SHEET, not a measurement:
# nothing here has been read from a live backend, per-qubit variation on a real
# device spans roughly a factor of five around each median, and calibration
# moves daily.
#
# So this model is right to about an order of magnitude, and that is the claim
# it makes. It is enough for the thing a learner actually needs to see — that a
# deep circuit decoheres, that two-qubit gates dominate the error budget by an
# order of magnitude, and that readout is not free — and it is not enough to
# predict what a specific device will return on a specific day.
#
# TO MAKE IT REAL, rather than representative: with qiskit-ibm-runtime installed
# and IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN set, `NoiseModel.from_backend(service.backend(name))`
# builds this same object from that device's current calibration, per qubit and
# per gate. That is a network call on the request path, so it is not the default
# and is not wired up; see docs/PENNYLANE.md for the trade-off.
#
# The previous model was a flat depolarising probability of 0.02 for 1-qubit
# gates and 0.04 for 2-qubit ones, with no decoherence at all and no readout
# error. 0.02 has no source; it is roughly 80x IBM's median 1-qubit error and
# 3x its median 2-qubit error, so it got the ABSOLUTE size wrong in one
# direction and the RATIO between one- and two-qubit gates wrong in the other —
# on real hardware a CX is ~30x worse than an X, not 2x. A learner tuning a
# circuit against it would draw the wrong conclusion about where to spend depth.

DEVICE_T1_SECONDS = 230e-6
