#
# The qubit cap was enforced AFTER parse_qasm() had already built the circuit:
#
#     circuit = parse_qasm(qasm)                       # <- unbounded work here
#     if circuit.num_qubits > backend.max_qubits: ...  # <- cap checked too late
#
# Measured on this machine: the 50-byte body `qreg q[3000000];` makes Qiskit
# allocate ~600 MB and burn 5.6 s of CPU before the check is reached, and the
# cost is linear in the declared width, so a slightly larger literal OOM-kills
# the process. The QASM source itself was unbounded too.
#
# These two checks are cheap string work and run BEFORE any parser is invoked.
# They are a floor, not a replacement for the real cap: the post-parse check
# still runs and still owns the exact per-backend limit.
