"""Liveness, capability reporting and real dependency probes.

A HEALTH CHECK THAT CANNOT FAIL IS DECORATION. The previous version of this
module returned ``{"status": "ok"}`` unconditionally: it proved that uvicorn was
listening and Python could build a dict, which the TCP connect had already
proven. It stayed green through a broken Aer install, a dead Redis, and a
qiskit import that only fails on the first real circuit.

So this module now executes one one-qubit circuit end to end and pings the job
store. What it deliberately does NOT do is talk to IBM, AWS or Azure: those
calls are rate-limited, some are billed, and the container ``HEALTHCHECK`` runs
every 30 seconds forever. Provider readiness is reported from credential and
SDK presence, and the response says so via ``checked: false`` so nobody mistakes
"configured" for "reachable".

STATUS CODE IS THE CONTRACT. 503 when something configured is not working, 200
otherwise, because Docker, Kubernetes and every uptime monitor read the code and
none of them parses the body. ``/api/health`` is also exempt from the shared-
secret gate (app/core/security.py) — a liveness probe cannot be handed a secret.

#: MEASURED COST IN THIS CONTAINER: ~1350ms on the first call (cold import of
#: the PennyLane/Aer stack), ~3ms on every call after. The first number is why
#: docker-compose gives this service a 40-second `start_period` — a shorter
#: grace window restarts a service that is merely still importing, forever. The
#: second is why running a real circuit on every probe is affordable at a
#: 30-second interval. Re-measure before quoting either.
#:
#: NOTE the ``3.0``. The native OpenQASM 3 parser rejects a bare ``OPENQASM 3;``
#: with "expected FLOAT_NUMBER", and this container has no
#: ``qiskit_qasm3_import`` to fall back to — so a probe written the obvious way
#: reports the whole service as failing when nothing is wrong with it. Match
#: app/quantum/presets.py, which is what real requests look like.
