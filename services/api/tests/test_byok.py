"""Offline tests for BYOK: presenting a USER'S OWN vendor credential.

Nothing here reaches a network. The assertions are on the things that are
invisible until a real job has been billed to the wrong account:

* that a presented token is the one the SDK is built with,
* that it is NEVER written into the process-global ``settings``,
* that the service cache cannot hand one user's authenticated service to
  another user's request,
* and that a request which cannot honour the credential is REFUSED rather than
  quietly run on the operator's account.

That last one is the whole point. Every failure mode this feature has looks
like success: the job runs, the histogram comes back, and the only trace that
it was billed to the wrong IBM account is in somebody else's console.
