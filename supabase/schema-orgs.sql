-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor AFTER schema.sql (it reuses

-- is no FK to cascade along), so revokeConsent() deletes this
-- row FIRST and the consent row second. Order matters: a failure
-- halfway must leave consent with no data, never data with no

-- Classes: per-class cohorts within one licence
--

-- that said "A COHORT IS AN ORG" as the permanent state of things:
-- a licence can now be divided into named classes, and an
-- assignment can target one of them.

-- #  A CLASS IS A TARGETING RULE, NOT AN ACCESS BOUNDARY.    #

-- #  Every permission check is still the ORG check that      #
-- #  lib/orgs/access.ts enforces on every request. A class   #
-- #  narrows who an assignment is FOR (and therefore the     #
-- #  denominator of every completion figure computed from    #
-- #  it); it does not narrow who may READ it — any active    #
-- #  seat on the licence can still list all of the org's     #
-- #  coursework, exactly as before. Do not put anything in a #
-- #  class-scoped assignment that must be hidden from the    #
-- #  rest of the licence. docs/CLASSROOM.md says the same.   #
